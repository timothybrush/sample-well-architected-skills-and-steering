# Well-Architected Skills & Steering for AI Coding Agents

Reusable skills and steering that teach AI coding agents how to apply the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Works with Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and Cline.

install.sh                          Setup script for any tool
```

## Quick start

### Install script (recommended)

```bash
# Install for a specific tool
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool claude-code
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool cursor
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool kiro

# Install for multiple tools
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool kiro --tool claude-code --tool cursor

# Install for all supported tools
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool all

# Use symlinks for automatic updates
./install.sh ~/my-project --tool claude-code --symlink

# Install globally (applies to all projects)
./install.sh --global --tool claude-code
```

Run `./install.sh --help` for full usage.

> **Note on `--global`**: Global installation places configuration files directly in your home directory (e.g., `~/CLAUDE.md`, `~/AGENTS.md`, `~/.clinerules`, `~/.windsurfrules`) or in global tool-specific directories (e.g., `~/.kiro/`, `~/.claude/`, `~/.cursor/`). These files apply to all projects that don't have their own project-level configuration. Use project-level installation (the default) if you only want Well-Architected guidance for specific projects.
>
> **Note on existing files**: The installer will prompt before overwriting any existing files. Use `--force` to skip the prompt and overwrite without confirmation.

### Manual installation

#### Kiro

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/steering .kiro/skills
cp path/to/this-repo/steering/well-architected.md .kiro/steering/
cp -r path/to/this-repo/skills/* .kiro/skills/
```

#### Claude Code

```bash
cp path/to/this-repo/adapters/claude-code/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
cp -r path/to/this-repo/adapters/claude-code/commands .claude/commands
```

#### Cursor

```bash
cp -r path/to/this-repo/adapters/cursor/rules .cursor/rules
```

#### Codex (OpenAI)

```bash
cp path/to/this-repo/adapters/codex/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
cp -r path/to/this-repo/skills ./skills
```

#### Windsurf

```bash
cp path/to/this-repo/adapters/windsurf/.windsurfrules ./.windsurfrules
```

#### GitHub Copilot

```bash
mkdir -p .github
cp path/to/this-repo/adapters/github-copilot/.github/copilot-instructions.md .github/
```

#### Cline

```bash
cp path/to/this-repo/adapters/cline/.clinerules ./.clinerules
```

#### AWS DevOps Agent

```bash
# Package all skills as zip files for upload to your Agent Space
./install.sh ~/output-dir --tool devops-agent
# Then upload each .zip from ~/output-dir/devops-agent-skills/ via the Operator Web App
```

## How it works

**Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) are self-contained, tool-agnostic playbooks. Any AI coding agent can follow them step-by-step. They don't depend on steering or on each other.

**Steering** (`steering/*.md`) is Kiro-specific always-on context loaded into every conversation. Other tools use equivalent mechanisms (see adapters).

**Adapters** (`adapters/`) translate the steering into each tool's native config format and wire up skills as commands or rules.

| Tool | Steering mechanism | Skills mechanism |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/*.md` | `.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/commands/*.md` (slash commands) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.md` | Rules with conditional activation |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | References `skills/` directory |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | References `skills/` directory |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Inline (no separate skill mechanism) |
| Cline | `.clinerules` | References `skills/` directory |
| AWS DevOps Agent | N/A (skills are self-contained) | `SKILL.md` zip upload to Agent Space |

## Skills overview

| Skill | Pillar(s) | Use when you need to... |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `wa-review` | All 6 | Run a full Well-Architected review |
| `reliability-improvement-plan` | Reliability | Find and eliminate single points of failure |
| `security-assessment` | Security | Assess IAM, detection, data protection, incident response |
| `cost-optimization-audit` | Cost Optimization | Identify waste and right-sizing opportunities |
| `performance-efficiency` | Performance Efficiency | Evaluate resource selection, scaling, and caching |
| `sustainability-optimization` | Sustainability | Reduce carbon footprint and resource waste |
| `migration-readiness` | All 6 | Assess readiness to migrate a workload to AWS |
| `operational-excellence` | Operational Excellence | Assess CI/CD, observability, incident management, operational maturity |
| `architecture-decision-record` | All 6 | Document a design decision with WA pillar impact |

## Verifying it works

Ask your AI coding agent:

```text
What Well-Architected pillars should I consider for this architecture?
```

If configured correctly, it will reference all six pillars with specific guidance rather than giving a generic answer. For Claude Code, try `/wa-review` to invoke the full review skill.
