# Well-Architected Review

## Step 1: Define the workload scope

Ask the user to describe the workload:

> What workload would you like me to review? Please share:
> - **Workload name** and brief description
> - **Code packages/directories** to analyze (IaC, application code, CI/CD configs)
> - **Business criticality** (critical, high, standard, low)
> - **Current pain points** (optional — anything you already know is problematic)

If the user has already provided architecture details or you are in a codebase with IaC, skip the prompt and proceed with discovery.

**IMPORTANT**: When no code or IaC is available to analyze (e.g., the user describes their architecture verbally), proceed with the review based on the information provided. Produce the full report using the architecture description as evidence. Mark findings where you cannot verify implementation details as "Based on description — verify in code." Do NOT ask for code if the user has already given you enough context to perform a meaningful review.

Determine if a specialized WA Lens applies:
- SaaS, Serverless, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, IoT, Containers, Games, Financial Services, Healthcare

If a lens is obvious from the code (e.g., Lambda-heavy → serverless), note it and apply lens-specific questions.

## Step 2: Infrastructure Discovery

Analyze all infrastructure-as-code and deployment configurations in the codebase.

You MUST examine:
- CDK code (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go)
- CloudFormation templates (YAML, JSON)
- Terraform configurations (.tf files)
- SAM/Serverless Framework templates
- CI/CD pipeline definitions (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Monitoring configurations (CloudWatch alarms, dashboards)
- Deployment configurations (CodeDeploy, ECS deployment settings)

For each infrastructure component, document:
- Resource type, logical name, and configuration
- File path and line numbers where defined
- Security-relevant configs (IAM, encryption, network)
- Resilience configs (multi-AZ, backups, scaling)
- Cost-relevant configs (instance types, capacity mode)

You MUST create an architecture diagram in PlantUML showing:
- All major components and their relationships
- Data flows and external dependencies
- Trust and network boundaries

## Step 3: Application Architecture Discovery

Analyze application code for architectural patterns:
- Entry points (API handlers, event processors, scheduled tasks)
- Service communication patterns (sync/async, retries, timeouts, circuit breakers)
- Data access patterns (queries, caching, connection management)
- Error handling and resilience patterns
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Observability instrumentation (logging, tracing, metrics)

## Step 4: Evaluate EVERY WA Framework question with code evidence

Assess the workload against ALL 58 questions in the Well-Architected Framework. For each question, provide:
- **Status**: "Implemented", "Partially Implemented", "Not Implemented", "Cannot Determine"
- **Evidence**: specific file paths and line numbers
- **Gaps**: what's missing or could be improved

## Step 5: Risk Assessment

For each finding, assess using Impact × Likelihood:

**Impact**: Minor (limited blast radius) | Moderate (subset of users affected) | Severe (full outage, data loss, regulatory violation)

**Likelihood**: Low (specific conditions required) | Medium (possible under normal operations) | High (common failure mode, weak controls)

| Impact   | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Severe   | High       | Critical   |
| Severe   | Medium     | High       |
| Severe   | Low        | High       |
| Moderate | High       | High       |
| Moderate | Medium     | Medium     |
| Moderate | Low        | Medium     |
| Minor    | High       | Medium     |
| Minor    | Medium     | Low        |
| Minor    | Low        | Low        |

Identify cross-pillar conflicts:
- Security controls that impact performance
- Cost optimizations that reduce reliability
- Reliability patterns that increase cost

## Prioritize Improvements — Eisenhower Matrix

Not all findings should be addressed at once. Focus on a selected number of issues that make the most business impact and are easiest to implement. Then iterate.

Classify each finding by **importance** (business value) and **effort** (time, complexity, headcount):

```
        HIGH IMPORTANCE
             │
   ┌─────────┼─────────┐
   │  DO     │  PLAN   │
   │  FIRST  │         │
   │         │         │
───┼─────────┼─────────┼───
   │         │         │
   │DELEGATE │  DEFER  │
   │         │         │
   └─────────┼─────────┘
             │
        LOW IMPORTANCE
   LOW EFFORT    HIGH EFFORT
```

| Quadrant | Action | Findings |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Do First** (High Importance, Low Effort) | Implement immediately | {finding IDs} |
| **Plan** (High Importance, High Effort) | Schedule in roadmap, break into phases | {finding IDs} |
| **Delegate** (Low Importance, Low Effort) | Batch together, assign to available team member | {finding IDs} |
| **Defer** (Low Importance, High Effort) | Revisit in next iteration | {finding IDs} |

### Solution Characteristics

For each solution in "Do First" and "Plan":
- **SMART goal**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Owner**: Identify who is responsible
- **Simple over complex**: Choose the simplest solution unless complexity is a non-negotiable requirement
- **Two-way door decisions**: Solutions should be extensible and evolve over time — avoid static solutions that cannot adapt
- **Pattern-based**: Target solutions that can be codified, reused, and re-shared (reference AWS Architecture Center)

## Prioritized Remediation Plan

### Quick Wins (< 1 week) — "Do First" quadrant
| Finding | Action | SMART Goal | Owner Suggestion | Effort |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
{Config changes, enabling features, adding tags/alarms — simple, high-impact}

### Foundation (1-4 weeks) — "Plan" quadrant
| Finding | Action | Phases | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
{Multi-AZ, CI/CD improvements, monitoring, caching — phased approach}

### Strategic (1-3 months) — "Plan" quadrant (complex)
| Finding | Action | Phases | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
{DR, re-architecture, compliance programs — two-way door design}

### Deferred — Revisit Next Iteration
{Findings in "Delegate" and "Defer" quadrants with brief justification for deferral}

## Step 7: Offer follow-up

After delivering the report, offer:

> Would you like me to:
> - Deep-dive into a specific pillar with expanded analysis?
> - Generate IaC templates to remediate a specific finding?
> - Create a migration plan for a specific architectural change?
> - Compare your workload against a specific WA Lens in detail?
> - Generate automated checks (Config rules, custom metrics) for ongoing compliance?
> - Produce a WA Tool import for tracking in the AWS console?

## Calibration Guidance

- A workload with multi-AZ, encryption, CI/CD with rollback, monitoring, and auto-scaling is MATURE — most findings should be improvements, not Critical
- Do NOT manufacture Critical findings for a well-built workload — accuracy over alarm
- When business criticality is "low"/"standard", accept simpler architectures (single-region is fine for internal tools)
- When business criticality is "critical", apply stricter standards (multi-region DR, chaos testing, sub-minute RTO expected)
- Every finding MUST have code evidence — no generic recommendations without backing
- If something cannot be determined from code, say "Cannot Determine" and explain what runtime/interview data is needed
- Acknowledge strengths prominently — a mature workload should feel validated, not just criticized
