## Question SEC01

# SEC 1 — How do you securely operate your workload?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 8

---

# SEC01-BP01 Separate workloads using accounts

Establish common guardrails and isolation between environments
(such as production, development, and test) and workloads through
a multi-account strategy. Account-level separation is strongly
recommended, as it provides a strong isolation boundary for
security, billing, and access.

**Desired outcome:** An account structure that isolates cloud
operations, unrelated workloads, and environments into separate accounts, increasing security
across the cloud infrastructure.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Placing multiple unrelated workloads with different data sensitivity levels into the
same account.
- Poorly defined organizational unit (OU) structure.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Decreased scope of impact if a workload is inadvertently accessed.
- Central governance of access to AWS services, resources, and Regions.
- Maintain security of the cloud infrastructure with policies and centralized
administration of security services.
- Automated account creation and maintenance process.
- Centralized auditing of your infrastructure for compliance and regulatory
requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established**:
High

## Implementation guidance

AWS accounts provide a security isolation boundary between
workloads or resources that operate at different sensitivity
levels. AWS provides tools to manage your cloud workloads at
scale through a multi-account strategy to leverage this
isolation boundary. For guidance on the concepts, patterns,
and implementation of a multi-account strategy on AWS, see
[Organizing
Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html).

When you have multiple AWS accounts under central management,
your accounts should be organized into a hierarchy defined by
layers of organizational units (OUs). Security controls can
then be organized and applied to the OUs and member accounts,
establishing consistent preventative controls on member
accounts in the organization. The security controls are
inherited, allowing you to filter permissions available to
member accounts located at lower levels of an OU hierarchy. A
good design takes advantage of this inheritance to reduce the
number and complexity of security policies required to achieve
the desired security controls for each member account.

[AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) and
[AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html) are two services that you can use to
implement and manage this multi-account structure in your AWS
environment. AWS Organizations allows you to organize accounts
into a hierarchy defined by one or more layers of OUs, with
each OU containing a number of member accounts.
[Service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCPs) allow the organization
administrator to establish granular preventative controls on
member accounts, and
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) can be used to establish proactive and detective
controls on member accounts. Many AWS services
[integrate
with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html) to provide delegated
administrative controls and performing service-specific tasks
across all member accounts in the organization.

Layered on top of AWS Organizations,
[AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html) provides a one-click best practices setup
for a multi-account AWS environment with a
[landing
zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.html). The landing zone is the entry point to the
multi-account environment established by Control Tower.
Control Tower provides several
[benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/fast-and-secure-account-governance-with-customizations-for-aws-control-tower/)
over AWS Organizations. Three benefits that provide improved
account governance are:

- Integrated mandatory security controls that are automatically applied to accounts
admitted into the organization.
- Optional controls that can be turned on or off for a given set of OUs.
- [AWS Control Tower Account Factory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/account-factory.html) provides automated
deployment of accounts containing pre-approved baselines and
configuration options inside your organization.

**Implementation steps**

- **Design an organizational unit
structure:** A properly designed organizational
unit structure reduces the management burden required to
create and maintain service control policies and other
security controls. Your organizational unit structure should
be
[aligned
with your business needs, data sensitivity, and workload
structure](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/best-practices-for-organizational-units-with-aws-organizations/).
- **Create a landing zone for your
multi-account environment:** A landing zone
provides a consistent security and infrastructure foundation
from which your organization can quickly develop, launch,
and deploy workloads. You can use a
[custom-built
landing zone or AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-aws-environment/building-landing-zones.html) to orchestrate your
environment.
- **Establish guardrails:**
Implement consistent security guardrails for your
environment through your landing zone. AWS Control Tower
provides a list of
[mandatory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/mandatory-controls.html)
and
[optional](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/optional-controls.html)
controls that can be deployed. Mandatory controls are
automatically deployed when implementing Control Tower.
Review the list of highly recommended and optional controls,
and implement controls that are appropriate to your needs.
- **Restrict access to newly added
Regions**: For new AWS Regions, IAM resources such
as users and roles are only propagated to the Regions that
you specify. This action can be performed through the
[console
when using Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/region-deny.html), or by adjusting
[IAM
permission policies in AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-permissions-to-enable-accounts-for-upcoming-aws-regions/).
- **Consider AWS
[CloudFormation
StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html)**: StackSets help you deploy
resources including IAM policies, roles, and groups into
different AWS accounts and Regions from an approved
template.

# SEC01-BP02 Secure account root user and properties

The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account, with
full administrative access to all resources within the account, and
in some cases cannot be constrained by security policies. Deactivating
programmatic access to the root user, establishing appropriate
controls for the root user, and avoiding routine use of the root
user helps reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure of the root
credentials and subsequent compromise of the cloud environment.

**Desired outcome:**Securing the root user helps reduce the
chance that accidental or intentional damage can occur through the misuse of root user
credentials. Establishing detective controls can also alert the appropriate personnel when
actions are taken using the root user.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using the root user for tasks other than the few that require root user credentials.
- Neglecting to test contingency plans on a regular basis to verify the functioning of
critical infrastructure, processes, and personnel during an emergency.
- Only considering the typical account login flow and neglecting to consider or test
alternate account recovery methods.
- Not handling DNS, email servers, and telephone providers as part of the critical
security perimeter, as these are used in the account recovery flow.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Securing access to
the root user builds confidence that actions in your account are controlled and audited.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established**:
High

## Implementation guidance

AWS offers many tools to help secure your account. However,
because some of these measures are not turned on by default, you
must take direct action to implement them. Consider these
recommendations as foundational steps to securing your AWS account. As you implement these steps it’s important that you
build a process to continuously assess and monitor the security
controls.

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one identity
that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the
account. This identity is called the AWS account root user. You
can sign in as the root user using the email address and password
that you used to create the account. Due to the elevated access
granted to the AWS root user, you must limit use of the AWS root
user to perform tasks that
[specifically
require it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html). The root user login credentials must be closely
guarded, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should always be
used for the AWS account root user.

In addition to the normal authentication flow to log into your
root user using a username, password, and multi-factor
authentication (MFA) device, there are account recovery flows to
log into your AWS account root user given access to the email
address and phone number associated with your account. Therefore,
it is equally important to secure the root user email account
where the recovery email is sent and the phone number associated
with the account. Also consider potential circular dependencies
where the email address associated with the root user is hosted on
email servers or domain name service (DNS) resources from the same
AWS account.

When using AWS Organizations, there are multiple AWS accounts each
of which have a root user. One account is designated as the
management account and several layers of member accounts can then
be added underneath the management account. Prioritize securing
your management account’s root user, then address your member
account root users. The strategy for securing your management
account’s root user can differ from your member account root
users, and you can place preventative security controls on your
member account root users.

**Implementation steps**

The following implementation steps are recommended to establish controls for the root
user. Where applicable, recommendations are cross-referenced to [CIS AWS
Foundations benchmark version 1.4.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cis-controls-1.4.0.html). In addition to these steps, consult [AWS best
practice guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) for securing your AWS account and resources.

**Preventative controls**

- Set up accurate [contact
information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-update-contact-primary.html) for the account.

This information is used for the lost password recovery flow, lost MFA device
account recovery flow, and for critical security-related communications with your
team.
- Use an email address hosted by your corporate domain, preferably a distribution
list, as the root user’s email address. Using a distribution list rather than an
individual’s email account provides additional redundancy and continuity for access
to the root account over long periods of time.
- The phone number listed on the contact information should be a dedicated,
secure phone for this purpose. The phone number should not be listed or shared with
anyone.

- Do not create access keys for the root user. If access keys exist, remove them (CIS
1.4).

Eliminate any long-lived programmatic credentials (access and secret keys) for
the root user.
- If root user access keys already exist, you should transition processes using
those keys to use temporary access keys from an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, then [delete the root user access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-access-key.html#root-user-delete-access-key).

- Determine if you need to store credentials for the root user.

If you are using AWS Organizations to create new member accounts, the initial password
for the root user on new member accounts is set to a random value that is not
exposed to you. Consider using the password reset flow from your AWS Organization
management account to [gain access to the member account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_access-as-root) if needed.
- For standalone AWS accounts or the management AWS Organization account,
consider creating and securely storing credentials for the root user. Use MFA for
the root user.

- Use preventative controls for member account root users in AWS multi-account
environments.

Consider using the [Disallow Creation of Root Access Keys for the Root User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/strongly-recommended-controls.html#disallow-root-access-keys) preventative
guard rail for member accounts.
- Consider using the [Disallow Actions as a Root User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/strongly-recommended-controls.html#disallow-root-auser-actions) preventative guard rail for member
accounts.

- If you need credentials for the root user:

Use a complex password.
- Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user, especially for
AWS Organizations management (payer) accounts (CIS 1.5).
- Consider hardware MFA devices for resiliency and security, as single use
devices can reduce the chances that the devices containing your MFA codes might be
reused for other purposes. Verify that hardware MFA devices powered by a battery are
replaced regularly. (CIS 1.6)

To configure MFA for the root user, follow the instructions for creating
either a [virtual MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root) or [hardware MFA device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_physical.html#enable-hw-mfa-for-root).

- Consider enrolling multiple MFA devices for backup. [Up to 8 MFA devices
are allowed per account](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/you-can-now-assign-multiple-mfa-devices-in-iam/).

Note that enrolling more than one MFA device for the root user
automatically turns off the [flow for recovering
your account if the MFA device is lost](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/reset-root-user-mfa/).

- Store the password securely, and consider circular dependencies if storing the
password electronically. Don’t store the password in such a way that would require
access to the same AWS account to obtain it.

- Optional: Consider establishing a periodic password rotation schedule for the root
user.

Credential management best practices depend on your regulatory and policy
requirements. Root users protected by MFA are not reliant on the password as a
single factor of authentication.
- [Changing
the root user password](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_change-root.html) on a periodic basis reduces the risk that an
inadvertently exposed password can be misused.

**Detective controls**

- Create alarms to detect use of the root credentials (CIS 1.7). [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_settingup.html) can monitor and alert on root user API credential usage through the
[RootCredentialUsage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-iam.html#policy-iam-rootcredentialusage) finding.
- Evaluate and implement the detective controls included in the [AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar conformance pack for AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/operational-best-practices-for-wa-Security-Pillar.html), or if
using AWS Control Tower, the [strongly
recommended controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/strongly-recommended-controls.html) available inside Control Tower.

**Operational guidance**

- Determine who in the organization should have access to the root user credentials.

Use a two-person rule so that no one individual has access to all necessary
credentials and MFA to obtain root user access.
- Verify that the organization, and not a single individual, maintains control
over the phone number and email alias associated with the account (which are used
for password reset and MFA reset flow).

- Use root user only by exception (CIS 1.7).

The AWS root user must not be used for everyday tasks, even administrative
ones. Only log in as the root user to perform [AWS tasks that require
root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html). All other actions should be performed by other users assuming
appropriate roles.

- Periodically check that access to the root user is functioning so that procedures
are tested prior to an emergency situation requiring the use of the root user
credentials.
- Periodically check that the email address associated with the account and those
listed under [Alternate
Contacts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-update-contact-alternate.html) work. Monitor these email inboxes for security notifications you
might receive from ``. Also ensure any phone numbers
associated with the account are working.
- Prepare incident response procedures to respond to root account misuse. Refer to
the [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.html) and the best practices in
the [Incident Response section of the Security Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/incident-response.html)
for more information on building an incident response strategy for your AWS account.

# SEC01-BP03 Identify and validate control objectives

Based on your compliance requirements and risks identified from your threat model, derive and validate the control objectives and controls that you need to apply to your workload. Ongoing validation of control objectives and controls help you measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation.

**Desired outcome:** The security control objectives of your business are well-defined and aligned to your compliance requirements. Controls are implemented and enforced through automation and policy and are continually evaluated for their effectiveness in achieving your objectives. Evidence of effectiveness at both a point in time and over a period of time are readily reportable to auditors.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Regulatory requirements, market expectations, and industry standards for assurable security are not well-understood for your business
- Your cybersecurity frameworks and control objectives are misaligned to the requirements of your business
- The implementation of controls does not strongly align to your control objectives in a measurable way
- You do not use automation to report on the effectiveness of your controls

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

There are many common cybersecurity frameworks that can form the basis for your security control objectives. Consider the regulatory requirements, market expectations, and industry standards for your business to determine which frameworks best supports your needs. Examples include [AICPA SOC 2](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/), [HITRUST](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hitrust/), [PCI-DSS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/), [ISO 27001](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-27001-faqs/), and [NIST SP 800-53](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/nist/).

For the control objectives you identify, understand how AWS services you consume help you to achieve those objectives. Use [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/) to find documentation and reports aligned to your target frameworks that describe the scope of responsibility covered by AWS and guidance for the remaining scope that is your responsibility. For further service-specific guidance as they align to various framework control statements, see [AWS Customer Compliance Guides](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Customer_Compliance_Guides.pdf).

As you define the controls that achieve your objectives, codify enforcement using preventative controls, and automate mitigations using detective controls. Help prevent non-compliant resource configurations and actions across your AWS Organizations using [service control policies (SCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). Implement rules in [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) to monitor and report on non-compliant resources, then switch rules to an enforcement model once confident in their behavior. To deploy sets of pre-defined and managed rules that align to your cybersecurity frameworks, evaluate the use of [AWS Security Hub CSPM standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/standards-reference.html) as your first option. The AWS Foundational Service Best Practices (FSBP) standard and the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark are good starting points with controls that align to many objectives that are shared across multiple standard frameworks. Where Security Hub CSPM does not intrinsically have the control detections desired, it can be complemented using [AWS Config conformance packs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html).

Use [APN Partner Bundles](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/gsca/bundles/) recommended by the AWS Global Security and Compliance Acceleration (GSCA) team to get assistance from security advisors, consulting agencies, evidence collection and reporting systems, auditors, and other complementary services when required.

### Implementation steps

- Evaluate common cybersecurity frameworks, and align your control objectives to the ones chosen.
- Obtain relevant documentation on guidance and responsibilities for your framework using AWS Artifact. Understand which parts of compliance fall on the AWS side of the shared responsibility model and which parts are your responsibility.
- Use SCPs, resource policies, role trust policies, and other guardrails to prevent non-compliant resource configurations and actions.
- Evaluate deploying Security Hub CSPM standards and AWS Config conformance packs that align to your control objectives.

# SEC01-BP04 Stay up to date with security threats and recommendations

Stay up to date with the latest threats and mitigations by
monitoring industry threat intelligence publications and data feeds
for updates. Evaluate managed service offerings that automatically
update based on the latest threat data.

**Desired outcome:** You stay
informed as industry publications are updated with the latest
threats and recommendations.  You use automation to detect potential
vulnerabilities and exposures as you identify new threats. You take
mitigating action against these threats.  You adopt AWS services
that automatically update with the latest threat intelligence.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not having a reliable and repeatable mechanism to stay informed
of the latest threat intelligence.
- Maintaining manual inventory of your technology portfolio,
workloads, and dependencies that require human review for
potential vulnerabilities and exposures.
- Not having mechanisms in place to update your workloads and
dependencies to the latest versions available that provide known
threat mitigations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Using threat intelligence sources to stay up to
date reduces the risk of missing out on important changes to the
threat landscape that can impact your business.  Having automation
in place to scan, detect, and remediate where potential
vulnerabilities or exposures exist in your workloads and their
dependencies can help you mitigate risks quickly and predictably,
compared to manual alternatives.  This helps control time and costs
related to vulnerability mitigation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Review trusted threat intelligence publications to stay on top of
the threat landscape.  Consult the
[MITRE
ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) knowledge base for documentation on known
adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Review
MITRE's [Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.org/) (CVE) list to stay informed
on known vulnerabilities in products you rely on. Understand
critical risks to web applications with the Open Worldwide
Application Security Project (OWASP)'s popular
[OWASP
Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) project.

Stay up to date on AWS security events and recommended remediation
steps with AWS
[Security
Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/) for CVEs.

To reduce your overall effort and overhead of staying up to date,
consider using AWS services that automatically incorporate new
threat intelligence over time.  For example, [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/)
stays up to date with industry threat intelligence for detecting
anomalous behaviors and threat signatures within your accounts.
[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) automatically keeps a database of the CVEs it
uses for its continuous scanning features up to date.  Both [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) and [AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-summary.html) provide managed rule groups that are
updated automatically as new threats emerge.

Review the
[Well-Architected
operational excellence pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html) for automated
fleet management and patching.

## Implementation steps

- Subscribe to updates for threat intelligence publications that
are relevant to your business and industry. Subscribe to the
AWS Security Bulletins.
- Consider adopting services that incorporate new threat
intelligence automatically, such as Amazon GuardDuty and
Amazon Inspector.
- Deploy a fleet management and patching strategy that aligns
with the best practices of the Well-Architected Operational
Excellence Pillar.

# SEC01-BP05 Reduce security management scope

Determine if you can reduce your security scope by using AWS services that shift management of certain controls to AWS (*managed services*). These services can help reduce your security maintenance tasks, such as infrastructure provisioning, software setup, patching, or backups.

**Desired outcome:** You consider the scope of your security management when selecting AWS services for your workload. The cost of management overhead and maintenance tasks (the total cost of ownership, or TCO) is weighed against the cost of the services you select, in addition to other Well-Architected considerations. You incorporate AWS control and compliance documentation into your control evaluation and verification procedures.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying workloads without thoroughly understanding the shared responsibility model for the services you select.
- Hosting databases and other technologies on virtual machines without having evaluated a managed service equivalent.
- Not including security management tasks into the total cost of ownership of hosting technologies on virtual machines when compared to managed service options.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Using managed services can reduce your overall burden of managing operational security controls, which can reduce your security risks and total cost of ownership. Time that would otherwise be spent on certain security tasks can be reinvested into tasks that provide more value to your business. Managed services can also reduce the scope of your compliance requirements by shifting some control requirements to AWS.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

There are multiple ways you can integrate the components of your workload on AWS. Installing and running technologies on Amazon EC2 instances often requires you to take on the largest share of the overall security responsibility. To help reduce the burden of operating certain controls, identify AWS managed services that reduce the scope of your side of the shared responsibility model and understand how you can use them in your existing architecture. Examples include using the [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for deploying databases, [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) or [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) for orchestrating containers, or using [serverless options](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/). When building new applications, think through which services can help reduce time and cost when it comes to implementing and managing security controls.

Compliance requirements can also be a factor when selecting services. Managed services can shift the compliance of some requirements to AWS. Discuss with your compliance team about their degree of comfort with auditing the aspects of services you operate and manage and accepting control statements in relevant AWS audit reports. You can provide the audit artifacts found in [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/) to your auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls. You can also use the responsibility guidance provided by some of the AWS audit artifacts to design your architecture, along with the [AWS Customer Compliance Guides](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Customer_Compliance_Guides.pdf). This guidance helps determine the additional security controls you should put in place in order to support the specific use cases of your system.

When using managed services, be familiar with the process of updating their resources to newer versions (for example, updating the version of a database managed by Amazon RDS, or a programming language runtime for an AWS Lambda function). While the managed service may perform this operation for you, configuring the timing of the update and understanding the impact on your operations remains your responsibility. Tools like [AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/) can help you track and manage these updates throughout your environments.

### Implementation steps

- Evaluate the components of your workload that can be replaced with a managed service.

If you are migrating a workload to AWS, consider the reduced management (time and expense) and reduction of risk when you assess if you should rehost, refactor, replatform, rebuild, or replace your workload. Sometimes additional investment at the start of a migration can have significant savings in the long run.

- Consider implementing managed services, like Amazon RDS, instead of installing and managing your own technology deployments.
- Use the responsibility guidance in AWS Artifact to help determine the security controls you should put in place for your workload.
- Keep an inventory of resources in use, and stay up-to-date with new services and approaches to identify new opportunities to reduce scope.

# SEC01-BP06 Automate deployment of standard security controls

Apply modern DevOps practices as you develop and deploy security
controls that are standard across your AWS environments.  Define
standard security controls and configurations using Infrastructure
as Code (IaC) templates, capture changes in a version control
system, test changes as part of a CI/CD pipeline, and automate the
deployment of changes to your AWS environments.

**Desired outcome:** IaC templates
capture standardized security controls and commit them to a version
control system.  CI/CD pipelines are in places that detect changes
and automate testing and deploying your AWS environments.
Guardrails are in place to detect and alert on misconfigurations in
templates before proceeding to deployment.  Workloads are deployed
into environments where standard controls are in place.  Teams have
access to deploy approved service configurations through a
self-service mechanism.  Secure backup and recovery strategies are
in place for control configurations, scripts, and related data.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Making changes to your standard security controls manually,
through a web console or command-line interface.
- Relying on individual workload teams to manually implement the
controls a central team defines.
- Relying on a central security team to deploy workload-level
controls at the request of a workload team.
- Allowing the same individuals or teams to develop, test, and
deploy security control automation scripts without proper
separation of duties or checks and balances.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Using templates to define your standard
security controls allows you to track and compare changes over time
using a version control system.  Using automation to test and deploy
changes creates standardization and predictability, increasing the
chances of a successful deployment and reducing manual repetitive
tasks.  Providing a self-serve mechanism for workload teams to
deploy approved services and configurations reduces the risk of
misconfiguration and misuse. This also helps them to incorporate
controls earlier in the development process.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

When following the practices described in
[SEC01-BP01 Separate workloads
using accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_securely_operate_multi_accounts.html), you will end up with multiple AWS accounts
for different environments that you manage using AWS Organizations.  While each of these environments and workloads may
need distinct security controls, you can standardize some security
controls across your organization.  Examples include integrating
centralized identity providers, defining networks and firewalls,
and configuring standard locations for storing and analyzing logs.
In the same way you can use *infrastructure as
code* (IaC) to apply the same rigor of application code
development to infrastructure provisioning, you can use IaC to
define and deploy your standard security controls as well.

Wherever possible, define your security controls in a declarative
way, such as in
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), and store them in a source control system.  Use DevOps practices to automate the deploying your
controls for more predictable releases, automated testing using
tools
like [AWS CloudFormation Guard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/what-is-guard.html), and detecting drift between your
deployed controls and your desired configuration.  You can use
services such as
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/),
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), and
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) to construct a CI/CD pipeline. Consider the
guidance in
[Organizing
Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/deployments-ou.html) to configure
these services in their own accounts that are separate from other
deployment pipelines.

You can also define templates to standardize defining and
deploying AWS accounts, services, and configurations.  This
technique allows a central security team to manage these
definitions and provide them to workload teams through a
self-service approach.  One way to achieve this is by using
[Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/), where you can publish templates as
*products* that workload teams can incorporate
into their own pipeline deployments.  If you are using
[AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/), some templates and controls are available as
a starting point.  Control Tower also provides
the [Account
Factory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/af-customization-page.html) capability, allowing workload teams to create new
AWS accounts using the standards you define.  This capability
helps remove dependencies on a central team to approve and create
new accounts when they are identified as needed by your workload
teams.  You may need these accounts to isolate different workload
components based on reasons such as the function they serve, the
sensitivity of data being processed, or their behavior.

## Implementation steps

- Determine how you will store and maintain your templates in a
version control system.
- Create CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy your templates.
Define tests to check for misconfigurations and that
templates adhere to your company standards.
- Build a catalog of standardized templates for workload teams
to deploy AWS accounts and services according to your
requirements.
- Implement secure backup and recovery strategies for your
control configurations, scripts, and related data.

# SEC01-BP07 Identify threats and prioritize mitigations using a threat model

Perform threat modeling to identify and maintain an up-to-date register of potential threats and associated mitigations for your workload. Prioritize your threats and adapt your security control mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond. Revisit and maintain this in the context of your workload, and the evolving security landscape.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

**What is threat modeling?**

“Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.” – [The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Application Threat Modeling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling)

**Why should you threat model?**

Systems are complex, and are becoming increasingly more complex and capable over time, delivering more business value and increased customer satisfaction and engagement. This means that IT design decisions need to account for an ever-increasing number of use cases. This complexity and number of use-case permutations typically makes unstructured approaches ineffective for finding and mitigating threats. Instead, you need a systematic approach to enumerate the potential threats to the system, and to devise mitigations and prioritize these mitigations to make sure that the limited resources of your organization have the maximum impact in improving the overall security posture of the system.

Threat modeling is designed to provide this systematic approach, with the aim of finding and addressing issues early in the design process, when the mitigations have a low relative cost and effort compared to later in the lifecycle. This approach aligns with the industry principle of [shift-left security](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest/00a-Overview). Ultimately, threat modeling integrates with an organization’s risk management process and helps drive decisions on which controls to implement by using a threat driven approach.

**When should threat modeling be performed?**

Start threat modeling as early as possible in the lifecycle of your workload, this gives you better flexibility on what to do with the threats you have identified. Much like software bugs, the earlier you identify threats, the more cost effective it is to address them. A threat model is a living document and should continue to evolve as your workloads change. Revisit your threat models over time, including when there is a major change, a change in the threat landscape, or when you adopt a new feature or service.

### Implementation steps

**How can we perform threat modeling?**

There are many different ways to perform threat modeling. Much like programming languages, there are advantages and disadvantages to each, and you should choose the way that works best for you. One approach is to start with [Shostack’s 4 Question Frame for Threat Modeling](https://github.com/adamshostack/4QuestionFrame), which poses open-ended questions to provide structure to your threat modeling exercise:

- **What are we working on?**

The purpose of this question is to help you understand and agree upon the system you are building and the details about that system that are relevant to security. Creating a model or diagram is the most popular way to answer this question, as it helps you to visualize what you are building, for example, using a [data flow diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_diagram). Writing down assumptions and important details about your system also helps you define what is in scope. This allows everyone contributing to the threat model to focus on the same thing, and avoid time-consuming detours into out-of-scope topics (including out of date versions of your system). For example, if you are building a web application, it is probably not worth your time threat modeling the operating system trusted boot sequence for browser clients, as you have no ability to affect this with your design.
- **What can go wrong?**

This is where you identify threats to your system. Threats are accidental or intentional actions or events that have unwanted impacts and could affect the security of your system. Without a clear understanding of what could go wrong, you have no way of doing anything about it.

There is no canonical list of what can go wrong. Creating this list requires brainstorming and collaboration between all of the individuals within your team and [relevant personas involved](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-approach-threat-modeling/#tips) in the threat modeling exercise. You can aid your brainstorming by using a model for identifying threats, such as [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)), which suggests different categories to evaluate: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privilege. In addition, you might want to aid the brainstorming by reviewing existing lists and research for inspiration, including the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), [HiTrust Threat Catalog](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-threat-catalogue/), and your organization’s own threat catalog.
- **What are we going to do about it?**

As was the case with the previous question, there is no canonical list of all possible mitigations. The inputs into this step are the identified threats, actors, and areas of improvement from the previous step.

Security and compliance is a [shared responsibility between you and AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). It’s important to understand that when you ask “What are we going to do about it?”, that you are also asking “Who is responsible for doing something about it?”. Understanding the balance of responsibilities between you and AWS helps you scope your threat modeling exercise to the mitigations that are under your control, which are typically a combination of AWS service configuration options and your own system-specific mitigations.

For the AWS portion of the shared responsibility, you will find that [AWS services are in-scope of many compliance programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/). These programs help you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and compliance of the cloud. The audit reports from these programs are available for download for AWS customers from [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/).

Regardless of which AWS services you are using, there’s always an element of customer responsibility, and mitigations aligned to these responsibilities should be included in your threat model. For security control mitigations for the AWS services themselves, you want to consider implementing security controls across domains, including domains such as identity and access management (authentication and authorization), data protection (at rest and in transit), infrastructure security, logging, and monitoring. The documentation for each AWS service has a [dedicated security chapter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/) that provides guidance on the security controls to consider as mitigations. Importantly, consider the code that you are writing and its code dependencies, and think about the controls that you could put in place to address those threats. These controls could be things such as [input validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html), [session handling](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2014-risks/m9-improper-session-handling), and [bounds handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow). Often, the majority of vulnerabilities are introduced in custom code, so focus on this area.
- **Did we do a good job?**

The aim is for your team and organization to improve both the quality of threat models and the velocity at which you are performing threat modeling over time. These improvements come from a combination of practice, learning, teaching, and reviewing. To go deeper and get hands on, it’s recommended that you and your team complete the [Threat modeling the right way for builders training course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/13274/threat-modeling-the-right-way-for-builders-workshop) or [workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US). In addition, if you are looking for guidance on how to integrate threat modeling into your organization’s application development lifecycle, see [How to approach threat modeling](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-approach-threat-modeling/) post on the AWS Security Blog.

**Threat Composer**

To aid and guide you in performing threat modeling, consider using the [Threat Composer](https://github.com/awslabs/threat-composer#threat-composer) tool, which aims to your reduce time-to-value when threat modeling. The tool helps you do the following:

- Write useful threat statements aligned to [threat grammar](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/what-can-go-wrong/threat-grammar) that work in a natural non-linear workflow
- Generate a human-readable threat model
- Generate a machine-readable threat model to allow you treat threat models as code
- Help you to quickly identify areas of quality and coverage improvement using the Insights Dashboard

# SEC01-BP08 Evaluate and implement new security services and features regularly

Evaluate and implement security services and features from AWS and
AWS Partners that help you evolve the security posture of your
workload.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
standard practice in place that informs you of new features and
services released by AWS and AWS Partners. You evaluate how these
new capabilities influence the design of current and new controls
for your environments and workloads.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You don't subscribe to AWS blogs and RSS feeds to learn of
relevant new features and services quickly
- You rely on news and updates about security services and
features from second-hand sources
- You don't encourage AWS users in your organization to stay
informed on the latest updates

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When you stay on top of new security services
and features, you can make informed decisions about the
implementation of controls in your cloud environments and workloads.
These sources help raise awareness of the evolving security
landscape and how AWS services can be used to protect against new
and emerging threats.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

AWS informs customers of new security services and features
through several channels:

- [AWS What's
New](https://aws.amazon.com/new)
- [AWS News
Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/)
- [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/)
- [AWS Security Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/)
- [AWS documentation overview](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/)

You can subscribe to an
[AWS Daily Feature Updates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/subscribe-to-aws-daily-feature-updates-via-amazon-sns/) topic using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) for a comprehensive daily
summary of updates. Some security services, such as
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_sns.html) and
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-announcements.html), provide their own SNS topics to stay informed
about new standards, findings, and other updates for those
particular services.

New services and features are also announced and described in
detail during
[conferences,
events, and webinars](https://aws.amazon.com/events/) conducted around the globe each year.
Of particular note is the annual
[AWS re:Inforce](https://reinforce.awsevents.com/) security conference and the more
general [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) conference. The previously-mentioned AWS news
channels share these conference announcements about security and
other services, and you can view deep dive educational breakout
sessions online at the
[AWS Events channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AWSEventsChannel) on YouTube.

You can also ask your
[AWS account team](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/learn/meet-your-aws-account-team) about the latest security service updates and
recommendations. You can reach out to your team through the
[Sales
Support form](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/sales-support/) if you do not have their direct contact
information. Similarly, if you subscribed to
[AWS Enterprise Support,](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/enterprise/)you will receive weekly updates from
your Technical Account Manager (TAM) and can schedule a regular
review meeting with them.

### Implementation steps

- Subscribe to the various blogs and bulletins with your
favorite RSS reader or to the Daily Features Updates SNS
topic.
- Evaluate which AWS events to attend to learn first-hand
about new features and services.
- Set up meetings with your AWS account team for any questions
about updating security services and features.
- Consider subscribing to Enterprise Support to have regular
consultations with a Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Question SEC02

# SEC 2 — How do you manage identities for people and machines?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 6

---

# SEC02-BP01 Use strong sign-in mechanisms

Sign-ins (authentication using sign-in credentials) can present
risks when not using mechanisms like multi-factor authentication
(MFA), especially in situations where sign-in credentials have been
inadvertently disclosed or are easily guessed. Use strong sign-in
mechanisms to reduce these risks by requiring MFA and strong
password policies.

**Desired outcome:** Reduce the risks
of unintended access to credentials in AWS by using strong sign-in
mechanisms for [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) users, the
[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html),
[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html), and
third-party identity providers. This means requiring MFA, enforcing
strong password policies, and detecting anomalous login behavior.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not enforcing a strong password policy for your identities
including complex passwords and MFA.
- Sharing the same credentials among different users.
- Not using detective controls for suspicious sign-ins.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

There are several ways for human identities to sign in to AWS. It
is an AWS best practice to rely on a centralized identity provider
using federation (direct SAML 2.0 federation between AWS IAM and
the centralized IdP or using AWS IAM Identity Center) when
authenticating to AWS. In this case, establish a secure sign-in
process with your identity provider or Microsoft Active Directory.

When you first open an AWS account, you begin with an AWS account
root user. You should only use the account root user to set up
access for your users (and for
[tasks
that require the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)). It's important to turn on
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the account root user
immediately after opening your AWS account and to secure the root
user using the
[AWS best practice guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html).

AWS IAM Identity Center is designed for workforce users, and you
can create and manage user identities within the service and
secure the sign-in process with MFA. AWS Cognito, on the other
hand, is designed for customer identity and access management
(CIAM), which provides user pools and identity providers for
external user identities in your applications.

If you create users in AWS IAM Identity Center, secure the sign-in
process in that service and
[turn
on MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html). For external user identities in your applications,
you can use
[Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/index.html) and secure the sign-in process in that
service or through one of the supported identity providers in
Amazon Cognito user pools.

Additionally, for users in AWS IAM Identity Center, you can use
[AWS Verified Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verified-access/latest/ug/what-is-verified-access.html) to provide an additional layer of security
by verifying the user's identity and device posture before they
are granted access to AWS resources.

If you are using
[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) users, secure the sign-in process
using IAM.

You can use both AWS IAM Identity Center and direct IAM federation
simultaneously to manage access to AWS. You can use IAM federation
to manage access to the AWS Management Console and services and IAM Identity Center to manage access to business applications like Quick or Amazon Q Business.

Regardless of the sign-in method, it's critical to enforce a
strong sign-in policy.

### Implementation steps

The following are general strong sign-in recommendations. The
actual settings you configure should be set by your company
policy or use a standard like
[NIST
800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

- Require MFA. It's an
[IAM
best practice to require MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#enable-mfa-for-privileged-users) for human identities and
workloads. Turning on MFA provides an additional layer of
security requiring that users provide sign-in credentials
and a one-time password (OTP) or a cryptographically
verified and generated string from a hardware device.
- Enforce a minimum password length, which is a primary factor
in password strength.
- Enforce password complexity to make passwords more difficult
to guess.
- Allow users to change their own passwords.
- Create individual identities instead of shared credentials.
By creating individual identities, you can give each user a
unique set of security credentials. Individual users provide
the ability to audit each user's activity.

IAM Identity Center recommendations:

- IAM Identity Center provides a predefined
[password
policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/password-requirements.html) when using the default directory that
establishes password length, complexity, and reuse
requirements.
- [Turn
on MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/mfa-enable-how-to.html) and configure the context-aware or always-on
setting for MFA when the identity source is the default
directory, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, or AD Connector.
- Allow users to
[register
their own MFA devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/how-to-allow-user-registration.html).

Amazon Cognito user pools directory recommendations:

- Configure the
[Password
strength](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-policies.html) settings.
- [Require
MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html) for users.
- Use the Amazon Cognito user pools
[advanced
security settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html) for features like
[adaptive
authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html) which can block suspicious sign-ins.

IAM user recommendations:

- Ideally you are using IAM Identity Center or direct
federation. However, you might have the need for IAM users.
In that case,
[set
a password policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html) for IAM users. You can use the
password policy to define requirements such as minimum
length or whether the password requires non-alphabetic
characters.
- Create an IAM policy to
[enforce
MFA sign-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_users-self-manage-mfa-and-creds.html#tutorial_mfa_step1) so that users are allowed to manage their
own passwords and MFA devices.

# SEC02-BP02 Use temporary credentials

When doing any type of authentication, it's best to use temporary
credentials instead of long-term credentials to reduce or eliminate
risks, such as credentials being inadvertently disclosed, shared, or
stolen.

**Desired outcome:** To reduce the
risk of long-term credentials, use temporary credentials wherever
possible for both human and machine identities. Long-term
credentials create many risks, such as exposure through uploads to
public repositories. By using temporary credentials, you
significantly reduce the chances of credentials becoming
compromised.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Developers using long-term access keys from IAM users rather
than obtaining temporary credentials from the CLI using
federation.
- Developers embedding long-term access keys in their code and
uploading that code to public Git repositories.
- Developers embedding long-term access keys in mobile apps that
are then made available in app stores.
- Users sharing long-term access keys with other users, or
employees leaving the company with long-term access keys still
in their possession.
- Using long-term access keys for machine identities when
temporary credentials could be used.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Use temporary security credentials instead of long-term
credentials for all AWS API and CLI requests. API and CLI requests
to AWS services must, in nearly every case, be signed using
[AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). These requests can be signed with either
temporary or long-term credentials. The only time you should use
long-term credentials, also known as long-term access keys, is if
you are using an
[IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) or the
[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html). When you federate to AWS or assume an
[IAM
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) through other methods, temporary credentials are
generated. Even when you access the AWS Management Console using
sign-in credentials, temporary credentials are generated for you
to make calls to AWS services. There are few situations where you
need long-term credentials and you can accomplish nearly all tasks
using temporary credentials.

Avoiding the use of long-term credentials in favor of temporary
credentials should go hand in hand with a strategy of reducing the
usage of IAM users in favor of federation and IAM roles. While IAM users have been used for both human and machine identities in the
past, we now recommend not using them to avoid the risks in using
long-term access keys.

### Implementation steps

#### Human identities

For workforce identities like employees, administrators,
developers, and operators:

- You should [rely on a
centralized identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html) and
[require
human users to use federation with an identity provider to
access AWS using temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-users-federation-idp). Federation
for your users can be done either with
[direct
federation to each AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/) or using
[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) and the identity provider of
your choice. Federation provides a number of advantages
over using IAM users in addition to eliminating long-term
credentials. Your users can also request temporary
credentials from the command line for
[direct
federation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-implement-federated-api-and-cli-access-using-saml-2-0-and-ad-fs/) or by using
[IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html). This means that there are few uses
cases that require IAM users or long-term credentials for
your users.

For third-party identities:

- When granting third parties,
such as software as a service (SaaS) providers, access to
resources in your AWS account, you can use
[cross-account
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) and
[resource-based
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html). Additionally, you can use the
[Amazon Cognito OAuth 2.0 grant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/federation-endpoints-oauth-grants.html) client credentials flow for B2B
SaaS customers or partners.

User identities that access your AWS resources through web
browsers, client applications, mobile apps, or interactive
command-line tools:

- If you need to grant applications for
consumers or customers access to your AWS resources, you can
use
[Amazon Cognito identity pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html) or
[Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) to provide temporary credentials.
The permissions for the credentials are configured through IAM
roles. You can also define a separate IAM role with limited
permissions for guest users who are not authenticated.

#### Machine identities

For machine identities, you might need to use long-term
credentials. In these cases, you should
[require
workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to
access AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-workloads-use-roles).

- For
[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) (Amazon EC2), you can use
[roles
for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html).
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) allows you to configure a
[Lambda
execution role to grant the service permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html) to
perform AWS actions using temporary credentials. There are
many other similar models for AWS services to grant
temporary credentials using IAM roles.
- For IoT devices, you can use the
[AWS IoT Core credential provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html) to request temporary
credentials.
- For on-premises systems or systems that run outside of AWS
that need access to AWS resources, you can use
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html).

There are scenarios where temporary credentials are not
supported, which require the use of long-term credentials. In
these situations, [audit and
rotate these credentials periodically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html) and
[rotate
access keys regularly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials). For highly restricted IAM user
access keys, consider the following additional security
measures:

- Grant highly restricted permissions:

Adhere to the principle of least privilege (be
specific about actions, resources, and conditions).
- Consider granting the IAM user only the
AssumeRole operation for one
specific role. Depending on the on-premise
architecture, this approach helps isolate and secure
the long-term IAM credentials.

- Limit the allowed network sources and IP addresses in the
IAM role trust policy.
- Monitor usage and set up alerts for unused permissions or
misuse (using AWS CloudWatch Logs metric filters and
alarms).
- Enforce
[permission
boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) (service control policies (SCPs) and
permission boundaries complement each other - SCPs are
coarse-grained, while permission boundaries are
fine-grained).
- Implement a process to provision and securely store (in an
on-premise vault) the credentials.

Some other options for scenarios requiring long-term
credentials include:

- Build your own token vending API (using Amazon API Gateway).
- For scenarios where you must use long-term credentials or
credentials other than AWS access keys (such as database
logins), you can use a service designed to handle the
management of secrets, such as
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). Secrets Manager simplifies the
management, rotation, and secure storage of encrypted
secrets. Many AWS services support a
[direct
integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/integrating.html) with Secrets Manager.
- For multi-cloud integrations, you can use identity
federation based on your source credential service
provider (CSP) credentials (see
[AWS STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html)).

For more information about rotating long-term credentials, see
[rotating
access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey).

# SEC02-BP03 Store and use secrets securely

A workload requires an automated capability to prove its identity to
databases, resources, and third-party services. This is accomplished
using secret access credentials, such as API access keys, passwords,
and OAuth tokens. Using a purpose-built service to store, manage,
and rotate these credentials helps reduce the likelihood that those
credentials become compromised.

**Desired outcome:** Implementing a
mechanism for securely managing application credentials that
achieves the following goals:

- Identifying what secrets are required for the workload.
- Reducing the number of long-term credentials required by
replacing them with short-term credentials when possible.
- Establishing secure storage and automated rotation of remaining
long-term credentials.
- Auditing access to secrets that exist in the workload.
- Continual monitoring to verify that no secrets are embedded in
source code during the development process.
- Reduce the likelihood of credentials being inadvertently
disclosed.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not rotating credentials.
- Storing long-term credentials in source code or configuration
files.
- Storing credentials at rest unencrypted.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Secrets are stored encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Access to credentials is gated through an API (think of it as a
*credential vending machine*).
- Access to a credential (both read and write) is audited and
logged.
- Separation of concerns: credential rotation is performed by a
separate component, which can be segregated from the rest of the
architecture.
- Secrets are automatically distributed on-demand to software
components and rotation occurs in a central location.
- Access to credentials can be controlled in a fine-grained
manner.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established**: High

## Implementation guidance

In the past, credentials used to authenticate to databases,
third-party APIs, tokens, and other secrets might have been
embedded in source code or in environment files. AWS provides
several mechanisms to store these credentials securely,
automatically rotate them, and audit their usage.

The best way to approach secrets management is to follow the
guidance of remove, replace, and rotate. The most secure
credential is one that you do not have to store, manage, or
handle. There might be credentials that are no longer necessary to
the functioning of the workload that can be safely removed.

For credentials that are still required for the proper functioning
of the workload, there might be an opportunity to replace a
long-term credential with a temporary or short-term credential.
For example, instead of hard-coding an AWS secret access key,
consider replacing that long-term credential with a temporary
credential using IAM roles.

Some long-lived secrets might not be able to be removed or
replaced. These secrets can be stored in a service such as
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html), where they can be centrally stored,
managed, and rotated on a regular basis.

An audit of the workload's source code and configuration files can
reveal many types of credentials. The following table summarizes
strategies for handling common types of credentials:

Credential type

Description

Suggested strategy

IAM access keys

AWS IAM access and secret keys used to assume IAM roles
inside of a workload

Replace: Use
[IAM
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios.html) assigned to the compute instances (such as
[Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html) or
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html)) instead. For interoperability with
third parties that require access to resources in your AWS account, ask if they support
[AWS cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html). For mobile apps,
consider using temporary credentials through
[Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).
For workloads running outside of AWS, consider
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) or
[AWS Systems Manager Hybrid Activations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/activations.html). For
containers see
[Amazon ECS task IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) or
[Amazon EKS node IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html).

SSH keys

Secure Shell private keys used to log into Linux EC2
instances, manually or as part of an automated process

Replace: Use
[AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/vr-beneficios-session-manager/) or
[EC2
Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html) to provide programmatic and human
access to EC2 instances using IAM roles.

Application and database credentials

Passwords – plain text string

Rotate: Store credentials in
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) and establish automated rotation if
possible.

Amazon RDS and Aurora Admin Database credentials

Passwords – plain text string

Replace: Use the
[Secrets Manager integration with Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) or
[Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html). In addition, some RDS database types can
use IAM roles instead of passwords for some use cases (for
more detail, see
[IAM
database authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html)).

OAuth tokens

Secret tokens – plain text string

Rotate: Store tokens in
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) and configure automated rotation.

API tokens and keys

Secret tokens – plain text string

Rotate: Store in
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) and establish automated rotation if
possible.

A common anti-pattern is embedding IAM access keys inside source
code, configuration files, or mobile apps. When an IAM access key
is required to communicate with an AWS service, use
[temporary
(short-term) security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html). These short-term
credentials can be provided through
[IAM
roles for EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) instances,
[execution
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html) for Lambda functions,
[Cognito
IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/iam-roles.html) for mobile user access, and
[IoT
Core policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html) for IoT devices. When interfacing with third
parties, prefer
[delegating
access to an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) with the necessary access to your
account's resources rather than configuring an IAM user and
sending the third party the secret access key for that user.

There are many cases where the workload requires the storage of
secrets necessary to interoperate with other services and
resources.
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) is purpose built to securely manage these
credentials, as well as the storage, use, and rotation of API
tokens, passwords, and other credentials.

AWS Secrets Manager provides five key capabilities to ensure the
secure storage and handling of sensitive credentials:
[encryption
at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security-encryption.html),

[encryption
in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/data-protection.html),

[comprehensive
auditing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html),

[fine-grained
access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html), and

[extensible
credential rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html). Other secret management services from
AWS Partners or locally developed solutions that provide similar
capabilities and assurances are also acceptable.

When you retrieve a secret, you can use the Secrets Manager client
side caching components to cache it for future use. Retrieving a
cached secret is faster than retrieving it from Secrets Manager.
Additionally, because there is a cost for calling Secrets Manager
APIs, using a cache can reduce your costs. For all of the ways you
can retrieve secrets, see
[Get
secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets.html).

Note
Some languages may
require you to implement your own in-memory encryption for client
side caching.

### Implementation steps

- Identify code paths containing hard-coded credentials using
automated tools such as
[Amazon CodeGuru](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/features/).

Use Amazon CodeGuru to scan your code repositories. Once
the review is complete, filter on
Type=Secrets in CodeGuru to find
problematic lines of code.

- Identify credentials that can be removed or replaced.

Identify credentials no longer needed and mark for
removal.
- For AWS Secret Keys that are embedded in source code,
replace them with IAM roles associated with the
necessary resources. If part of your workload is outside
AWS but requires IAM credentials to access AWS
resources, consider
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/extend-aws-iam-roles-to-workloads-outside-of-aws-with-iam-roles-anywhere/) or
[AWS Systems Manager Hybrid Activations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/activations.html).

- For other third-party, long-lived secrets that require the
use of the rotate strategy, integrate Secrets Manager into
your code to retrieve third-party secrets at runtime.

The CodeGuru console can automatically
[create
a secret in Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/codeguru-reviewer-secrets-detector-identify-hardcoded-secrets/) using the discovered
credentials.
- Integrate secret retrieval from Secrets Manager into
your application code.

Serverless Lambda functions can use a
language-agnostic
[Lambda
extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets_lambda.html).
- For EC2 instances or containers, AWS provides
example
[client-side
code for retrieving secrets from Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets.html) in several popular programming
languages.

- Periodically review your code base and re-scan to verify no
new secrets have been added to the code.

Consider using a tool such as
[git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
to prevent committing new secrets to your source code
repository.

- [Monitor
Secrets Manager activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html) for indications of
unexpected usage, inappropriate secret access, or attempts
to delete secrets.
- Reduce human exposure to credentials. Restrict access to
read, write, and modify credentials to an IAM role dedicated
for this purpose, and only provide access to assume the role
to a small subset of operational users.

# SEC02-BP04 Rely on a centralized identity provider

For workforce identities (employees and contractors), rely on an
identity provider that allows you to manage identities in a
centralized place. This makes it easier to manage access across
multiple applications and systems, because you are creating,
assigning, managing, revoking, and auditing access from a single
location.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
centralized identity provider where you centrally manage workforce
users, authentication policies (such as requiring multi-factor
authentication (MFA)), and authorization to systems and applications
(such as assigning access based on a user's group membership or
attributes). Your workforce users sign in to the central identity
provider and federate (single sign-on) to internal and external
applications, removing the need for users to remember multiple
credentials. Your identity provider is integrated with your human
resources (HR) systems so that personnel changes are automatically
synchronized to your identity provider. For example, if someone
leaves your organization, you can automatically revoke access to
federated applications and systems (including AWS). You have enabled
detailed audit logging in your identity provider and are monitoring
these logs for unusual user behavior.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You do not use federation and single-sign on. Your workforce
users create separate user accounts and credentials in multiple
applications and systems.
- You have not automated the lifecycle of identities for workforce
users, such as by integrating your identity provider with your
HR systems. When a user leaves your organization or changes
roles, you follow a manual process to delete or update their
records in multiple applications and systems.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By using a centralized identity provider, you
have a single place to manage workforce user identities and
policies, the ability to assign access to applications to users and
groups, and the ability to monitor user sign-in activity. By
integrating with your human resources (HR) systems, when a user
changes roles, these changes are synchronized to the identity
provider and automatically updates their assigned applications and
permissions. When a user leaves your organization, their identity is
automatically disabled in the identity provider, revoking their
access to federated applications and systems.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established**: High

## Implementation guidance

**Guidance for workforce users accessing
AWS** Workforce users like employees and contractors in
your organization may require access to AWS using the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to
perform their job functions. You can grant AWS access to your
workforce users by federating from your centralized identity
provider to AWS at two levels: direct federation to each AWS account or federating to multiple accounts in your
[AWS organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html).

To federate your workforce users directly with each AWS account,
you can use a centralized identity provider to federate to
[AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) in that account. The flexibility of IAM
allows you to enable a separate
[SAML
2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml.html) or an
[Open
ID Connect (OIDC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) Identity Provider for each AWS account
and use federated user attributes for access control. Your
workforce users will use their web browser to sign in to the
identity provider by providing their credentials (such as
passwords and MFA token codes). The identity provider issues a
SAML assertion to their browser that is submitted to the AWS Management Console sign in URL to allow the user to single sign-on
to the
[AWS Management Console by assuming an IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html). Your users can
also obtain temporary AWS API credentials for use in the
[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or
[AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/) from
[AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) by
[assuming
the IAM role using a SAML assertion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html) from the identity
provider.

To federate your workforce users with multiple accounts in your
AWS organization, you can use
[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) to centrally manage access
for your workforce users to AWS accounts and applications. You
enable Identity Center for your organization and configure your
identity source. IAM Identity Center provides a default identity
source directory which you can use to manage your users and
groups. Alternatively, you can choose an external identity source
by
[connecting
to your external identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-identity-source-idp.html) using SAML
2.0 and
[automatically
provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/provision-automatically.html) users and groups using SCIM, or
[connecting
to your Microsoft AD Directory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-identity-source-ad.html) using
[Directory Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/). Once an identity source is configured,
you can assign access to users and groups to AWS accounts by
defining least-privilege policies in your
[permission
sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html). Your workforce users can authenticate through your
central identity provider to sign in to the
[AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-the-portal.html) and single-sign on to the AWS accounts and
cloud applications assigned to them. Your users can configure the
[AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) to authenticate with Identity Center and get
credentials to run AWS CLI commands. Identity Center also allows
single-sign on access to AWS applications such as
[Amazon SageMaker AI Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-sso-users.html) and
[AWS IoT Sitewise Monitor portals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/monitor-getting-started.html).

After you follow the preceding guidance, your workforce users will
no longer need to use IAM users and groups for normal operations
when managing workloads on AWS. Instead, your users and groups are
managed outside of AWS and users are able to access AWS resources
as a *federated identity*. Federated identities
use the groups defined by your centralized identity provider. You
should identify and remove IAM groups, IAM users, and long-lived
user credentials (passwords and access keys) that are no longer
needed in your AWS accounts. You can
[find
unused credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_finding-unused.html) using
[IAM
credential reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html),
[delete
the corresponding IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html) and
[delete
IAM groups.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_delete.html) You can apply a
[Service
Control Policy (SCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) to your organization that helps
prevent the creation of new IAM users and groups, enforcing that
access to AWS is via federated identities.

Note
You are responsible for handling the rotation of SCIM
access tokens as described in the
[Automatic
provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/provision-automatically.html) documentation. Additionally, you are
responsible for rotating the certificates supporting your
identity federation.

**Guidance for users of your
applications** You can manage the identities of users of
your applications, such as a mobile app, using
[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as your centralized identity provider.
Amazon Cognito enables authentication, authorization, and user
management for your web and mobile apps. Amazon Cognito provides
an identity store that scales to millions of users, supports
social and enterprise identity federation, and offers advanced
security features to help protect your users and business. You can
integrate your custom web or mobile application with Amazon Cognito to add user authentication and access control to your
applications in minutes. Built on open identity standards such as
SAML and Open ID Connect (OIDC), Amazon Cognito supports various
compliance regulations and integrates with frontend and backend
development resources.

### Implementation steps

**Steps for workforce users accessing
AWS**

- Federate your workforce users to AWS using a centralized
identity provider using one of the following approaches:

Use IAM Identity Center to enable single sign-on to
multiple AWS accounts in your AWS organization by
federating with your identity provider.
- Use IAM to connect your identity provider directly to
each AWS account, enabling federated fine-grained
access.

- Identify and remove IAM users and groups that are replaced
by federated identities.

**Steps for users of your
applications**

- Use Amazon Cognito as a centralized identity provider
towards your applications.
- Integrate your custom applications with Amazon Cognito using
OpenID Connect and OAuth. You can develop your custom
applications using the Amplify libraries that provide simple
interfaces to integrate with a variety of AWS services, such
as Amazon Cognito for authentication.

# SEC02-BP05 Audit and rotate credentials periodically

Audit and rotate credentials periodically to limit how long the
credentials can be used to access your resources. Long-term
credentials create many risks, and these risks can be reduced by
rotating long-term credentials regularly.

**Desired outcome:** Implement
credential rotation to help reduce the risks associated with
long-term credential usage. Regularly audit and remediate
non-compliance with credential rotation policies.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not auditing credential use.
- Using long-term credentials unnecessarily.
- Using long-term credentials and not rotating them regularly.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

When you cannot rely on temporary credentials and require
long-term credentials, audit credentials to verify that defined
controls like
[multi-factor
authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/) (MFA) are enforced, rotated regularly, and
have the appropriate access level.

Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is
necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For
human identities, you should require users to change their
passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of
temporary credentials. As you move from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to centralized identities, you can
[generate
a credential report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html) to audit your users.

We also recommend that you enforce and monitor MFA in your
identity provider. You can set up
[AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html), or use
[AWS Security Hub CSPM Security Standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-iam-3), to monitor if users have
configured MFA. Consider using
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to provide temporary credentials for machine
identities. In situations when using IAM roles and temporary
credentials is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access
keys is necessary.

### Implementation steps

- **Regularly audit
credentials:** Auditing the identities that are
configured in your identity provider and IAM helps verify
that only authorized identities have access to your
workload. Such identities can include, but are not limited
to, IAM users, AWS IAM Identity Center users, Active
Directory users, or users in a different upstream identity
provider. For example, remove people that leave the
organization, and remove cross-account roles that are no
longer required. Have a process in place to periodically
audit permissions to the services accessed by an IAM entity.
This helps you identify the policies you need to modify to
remove any unused permissions. Use credential reports and
[AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) to
audit IAM credentials and permissions. You can use
[Amazon CloudWatch to set up alarms for specific API calls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html)
called within your AWS environment.
[Amazon GuardDuty can also alert you to unexpected activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-iam.html),
which might indicate overly permissive access or unintended
access to IAM credentials.
- **Rotate credentials
regularly:** When you are unable to use temporary
credentials, rotate long-term IAM access keys regularly
(maximum every 90 days). If an access key is unintentionally
disclosed without your knowledge, this limits how long the
credentials can be used to access your resources. For
information about rotating access keys for IAM users, see
[Rotating
access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey).
- **Review IAM permissions:**
To improve the security of your AWS account, regularly
review and monitor each of your IAM policies. Verify that
policies adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- **Consider automating IAM resource
creation and updates:**
[IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) automates many IAM tasks, such as
role and policy management. Alternatively, AWS CloudFormation can be used to automate the deployment of IAM
resources, including roles and policies, to reduce the
chance of human error because the templates can be verified
and version controlled.
- **Use IAM Roles Anywhere to replace
IAM users for machine identities:**
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) allows you to use roles in areas that
you traditionally could not, such as on-premise servers. IAM
Roles Anywhere uses a trusted
[X.509
certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/trust-model.html#signature-verification) to authenticate to AWS and receive
temporary credentials. Using IAM Roles Anywhere avoids the
need to rotate these credentials, as long-term credentials
are no longer stored in your on-premises environment. Please
note that you will need to monitor and rotate the X.509
certificate as it approaches expiration.

# SEC02-BP06 Employ user groups and attributes

Defining permissions according to user groups and attributes helps
reduce the number and complexity of policies, making it simpler to
achieve the principle of least privilege. You can use user groups to
manage the permissions for many people in one place based on the
function they perform in your organization. Attributes, such as
department, project, or location, can provide an additional layer of
permission scope when people perform a similar function but for
different subsets of resources.

**Desired outcome:** You can apply
changes in permissions based on function to all users who perform
that function. Group membership and attributes govern user
permissions, reducing the need to manage permissions at the
individual user level. The groups and attributes you define in your
identity provider (IdP) are propagated automatically to your AWS
environments.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Managing permissions for individual users and duplicating across
many users.
- Defining groups at too high a level, granting overly-broad
permissions.
- Defining groups at too granular a level, creating duplication
and confusion about membership.
- Using groups with duplicate permissions across subsets of
resources when attributes can be used instead.
- Not managing groups, attributes, and memberships through a
standardized identity provider integrated with your AWS
environments.
- Using role chaining when using AWS IAM Identity Center sessions

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

AWS permissions are defined in documents called
*policies* that are associated with a
principal, such as a user, group, role, or resource. You can scale
permissions management by organizing permissions assignments
(group, permissions, account) based on job-function, workload, and
SDLC environment. For your workforce, this allows you to define
groups based on the function your users perform for your
organization, rather than based on the resources being accessed.
For example, a WebAppDeveloper group may have a
policy attached for configuring services like Amazon CloudFront
within a development account. An
`AutomationDeveloper` group may have some
overlapping permissions with the
`WebAppDeveloper` group. These common permissions
can be captured in a separate policy and associated with both
groups, rather than having users from both functions belong to a
`CloudFrontAccess` group.

In addition to groups, you can use *attributes*
to further scope access. For example, you may have a
Project attribute for users in your
`WebAppDeveloper` group to scope access to
resources specific to their project. Using this technique removes
the need to have different groups for application developers
working on different projects if their permissions are otherwise
the same. The way you refer to attributes in permission policies
is based on their source, whether they are defined as part of your
federation protocol (such as SAML, OIDC, or SCIM), as custom SAML
assertions, or set within IAM Identity Center.

### Implementation steps

- Establish where you will define groups and attributes:

Following the guidance in
[SEC02-BP04 Rely on a
centralized identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html), you can determine
whether you need to define groups and attributes within
your identity provider, within IAM Identity Center, or
using IAM user groups in a specific account.

- Define groups:

Determine your groups based on function and scope of
access required. Consider using a hierarchical structure
or naming conventions to organize groups effectively.
- If defining within IAM Identity Center, create groups
and associate the desired level of access using
permission sets.
- If defining within an external identity provider,
determine if the provider supports the SCIM protocol and
consider enabling automatic provisioning within IAM Identity Center. This capability synchronizes the
creation, membership, and deletion of groups between
your provider and IAM Identity Center.

- Define attributes:

If you use an external identity provider, both the SCIM
and SAML 2.0 protocols provide certain attributes by
default. Additional attributes can be defined and passed
using SAML assertions with the
`https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag`
attribute name. Refer to your identity provider's
documentation for guidance on defining and configuring
custom attributes.
- If you define roles within IAM Identity Center, enable
the attribute-based access control (ABAC) feature, and
define attributes as desired. Consider attributes that
align with your organization's structure or resource
tagging strategy.

If you require IAM role chaining from IAM Roles assumed through
IAM Identity center, values like
`source-identity` and
`principal-tags` will not propagate. For more
detail, see
[Enable
and configure attributes for access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-abac.html).

- Scope permissions based on groups and attributes:

Consider including conditions in your permission
policies that compare the attributes of your principal
with the attributes of the resources being accessed. For
example, you can define a condition to allow access to a
resource only if the value of a
`PrincipalTag` condition key matches
the value of a `ResourceTag` key of the
same name.
- When defining ABAC policies, follow the guidance in the
[ABAC
authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) best practices and examples.
- Regularly review and update your group and attribute
structure as your organization's needs evolve to ensure
optimal permissions management.

## Implementation guidance

Each component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end
users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each
component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and
authorization.

Regular access to AWS accounts within the organization should be provided using [federated access](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/) or a centralized
identity provider. You should also centralize your identity management and ensure that there
is an established practice to integrate AWS access to your employee access lifecycle. For
example, when an employee changes to a job role with a different access level, their group
membership should also change to reflect their new access requirements.

When defining access requirements for non-human identities, determine which applications
and components need access and how permissions are granted. Using IAM roles built with the
least privilege access model is a recommended approach. [AWS Managed
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html) provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases.

AWS services, such as [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/identify-arrange-manage-secrets-easily-using-enhanced-search-in-aws-secrets-manager/) and [AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), can help decouple secrets from the application or workload securely. In Secrets Manager, you can establish
automatic rotation for your credentials. You can use Systems Manager to reference parameters in your
scripts, commands, SSM documents, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique
name that you specified when you created the parameter.

You can use
[AWS IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to obtain
[temporary
security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) for workloads that run outside
of AWS. Your workloads can use the same
[IAM
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) and
[IAM
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that you use with AWS applications to access AWS
resources.

Where possible, prefer short-term temporary credentials over
long-term static credentials. For scenarios in which you need
users with programmatic access and long-term credentials,
use [access
key last used information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey) to rotate and remove access keys.

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.

# SEC03-BP02 Grant least privilege access

Grant only the access that users require to perform specific actions
on specific resources under specific conditions. Use group and
identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather
than defining permissions for individual users. For example, you can
allow a group of developers access to manage only resources for
their project. This way, if a developer leaves the project, their
access is automatically revoked without changing the underlying
access policies.

**Desired outcome:** Users have only
the minimum permissions required for their specific job functions.
You use separate AWS accounts to isolate developers from production
environments. When developers need to access production environments
for specific tasks, they are granted limited and controlled access
only for the duration of those tasks. Their production access is
immediately revoked after they complete the necessary work. You
conduct regular reviews of permissions and promptly revoke them when
no longer needed, such as when a user changes roles or leaves the
organization. You restrict administrator privileges to a small,
trusted group to reduce risk exposure. You give machine or system
accounts only the minimum permissions required to perform their
intended tasks.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- By default, you grant users administrator permissions.
- You use the root user account for daily activities.
- You create overly permissive policies without proper scoping.
- Your permissions reviews are infrequent, which leads to
permissions creep.
- You rely solely on attribute-based access control for
environment isolation or permissions management.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

The principle of
[least
privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) states that identities should only be permitted
to perform the smallest set of actions necessary to fulfill a
specific task. This balances usability, efficiency, and security.
Operating under this principle helps limit unintended access and
helps track who has access to what resources. IAM users and roles
have no permissions by default. The root user has full access by
default and should be tightly controlled, monitored, and used only
for
[tasks
that require root access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html).

IAM policies are used to explicitly grant permissions to IAM roles
or specific resources. For example, identity-based policies can be
attached to IAM groups, while S3 buckets can be controlled by
resource-based policies.

When you create an IAM policy, you can specify the service
actions, resources, and conditions that must be true for AWS to
allow or deny access. AWS supports a variety of conditions to help
you scope down access. For example, by using the
PrincipalOrgID
[condition
key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html), you can deny actions if the requestor isn't a part of
your AWS Organization.

You can also control requests that AWS services make on your
behalf, such as AWS CloudFormation creating an AWS Lambda
function, using the CalledVia condition key.
You can layer different policy types to establish defense-in-depth
and limit the overall permissions of your users. You can also
restrict what permissions can be granted and under what
conditions. For example, you can allow your workload teams to
create their own IAM policies for systems they build, but only if
they apply a
[Permission
Boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) to limit the maximum permissions they can grant.

### Implementation steps

- **Implement least privilege
policies**: Assign access policies with least
privilege to IAM groups and roles to reflect the user's role
or function that you have defined.
- **Isolate development and production
environments through separate AWS accounts**: Use
separate AWS accounts for development and production
environments, and control access between them using
[service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html), resource policies, and identity
policies.
- **Base policies on API
usage**: One way to determine the needed
permissions is to review AWS CloudTrail logs. You can use
this review to create permissions tailored to the actions
that the user actually performs within AWS.
[IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) can
[automatically
generate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html) an IAM policy based on access activity. You
can use IAM Access Advisor at the organization or account
level to
[track
the last accessed information for a particular
policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html).
- **Consider using
[AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html)**: When
you begin to create fine-grained permissions policies, it
can be helpful to use AWS managed policies for common job
roles, such as billing, database administrators, and data
scientists. These policies can help narrow the access that
users have while you determine how to implement the least
privilege policies.
- **Remove unnecessary
permissions:** Detect and remove unused IAM
entities, credentials, and permissions to achieve the
principle of least privilege. You can use
[IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-findings.html) to identify external and unused
access, and
[IAM Access Analyzer policy generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html) can help fine-tune
permissions policies.
- **Ensure that users have limited
access to production environments:** Users should
only have access to production environments with a valid use
case. After the user performs the specific tasks that
required production access, access should be revoked.
Limiting access to production environments helps prevent
unintended production-impacting events and lowers the scope
of impact of unintended access.
- **Consider permissions
boundaries:** A
[permissions
boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) is a feature for using a managed policy that
sets the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy
can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary
allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by
both its identity-based policies and its permissions
boundaries.
- **Refine access using attribute-based
access control and resource tags**
[Attribute-based
access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) using resource tags can be used
to refine permissions when supported. You can use an ABAC
model that compares principal tags to resource tags to
refine access based on custom dimensions you define. This
approach can simplify and reduce the number of permission
policies in your organization.

It is recommended that ABAC only be used for access
control when both the principals and resources are owned
by your AWS Organization. External parties may use the
same tag names and values as your organization for their
own principals and resources. If you rely solely on
these name-value pairs for granting access to external
party principals or resources, you may provide
unintended permissions.

- **Use service control policies for AWS Organizations:**
[Service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) centrally control the maximum
available permissions for member accounts in your
organization. Importantly, you can use service control
policies to restrict root user permissions in member
accounts. Also consider using AWS Control Tower, which
provides prescriptive managed controls that enrich AWS Organizations. You can also define your own controls within
Control Tower.
- **Establish a user lifecycle policy
for your organization:** User lifecycle policies
define tasks to perform when users are onboarded onto AWS,
change job role or scope, or no longer need access to AWS.
Perform permission reviews during each step of a user's
lifecycle to verify that permissions are properly
restrictive and to avoid permissions creep.
- **Establish a regular schedule to
review permissions and remove any unneeded
permissions:** You should regularly review user
access to verify that users do not have overly permissive
access.
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) and IAM Access Analyzer can help during user
permissions audits.
- **Establish a job role
matrix:** A job role matrix visualizes the various
roles and access levels required within your AWS footprint.
With a job role matrix, you can define and separate
permissions based on user responsibilities within your
organization. Use groups instead of applying permissions
directly to individual users or roles.

# SEC03-BP03 Establish emergency access process

Create a process that allows for emergency access to your workloads
in the unlikely event of an issue with your centralized identity
provider.

You must design processes for different failure modes that may
result in an emergency event. For example, under normal
circumstances, your workforce users federate to the cloud using a
centralized identity provider
([SEC02-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html))
to manage their workloads. However, if your centralized identity
provider fails, or the configuration for federation in the cloud is
modified, then your workforce users may not be able to federate into
the cloud. An emergency access process allows authorized
administrators to access your cloud resources through alternate
means (such as an alternate form of federation or direct user
access) to fix issues with your federation configuration or your
workloads. The emergency access process is used until the normal
federation mechanism is restored.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have defined and documented the failure modes that count as
an emergency: consider your normal circumstances and the systems
your users depend on to manage their workloads. Consider how
each of these dependencies can fail and cause an emergency
situation. You may find the questions and best practices in the
[Reliability
pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/a-reliability.html) useful to identify failure modes and architect
more resilient systems to minimize the likelihood of failures.
- You have documented the steps that must be followed to confirm a
failure as an emergency. For example, you can require your
identity administrators to check the status of your primary and
standby identity providers and, if both are unavailable, declare
an emergency event for identity provider failure.
- You have defined an emergency access process specific to each
type of emergency or failure mode. Being specific can reduce the
temptation on the part of your users to overuse a general
process for all types of emergencies. Your emergency access
processes describe the circumstances under which each process
should be used, and conversely situations where the process
should not be used and points to alternate processes that may
apply.
- Your processes are well-documented with detailed instructions
and playbooks that can be followed quickly and efficiently.
Remember that an emergency event can be a stressful time for
your users and they may be under extreme time pressure, so
design your process to be as simple as possible.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You do not have well-documented and well-tested emergency access
processes. Your users are unprepared for an emergency and follow
improvised processes when an emergency event arises.
- Your emergency access processes depend on the same systems (such
as a centralized identity provider) as your normal access
mechanisms. This means that the failure of such a system may
impact both your normal and emergency access mechanisms and
impair your ability to recover from the failure.
- Your emergency access processes are used in non-emergency
situations. For example, your users frequently misuse emergency
access processes as they find it easier to make changes directly
than submit changes through a pipeline.
- Your emergency access processes do not generate sufficient logs
to audit the processes, or the logs are not monitored to alert
for potential misuse of the processes.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- By having well-documented and well-tested emergency access
processes, you can reduce the time taken by your users to
respond to and resolve an emergency event. This can result in
less downtime and higher availability of the services you
provide to your customers.
- You can track each emergency access request and detect and alert
on unauthorized attempts to misuse the process for non-emergency
events.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established**: Medium

## Implementation guidance

This section provides guidance for creating emergency access
processes for several failure modes related to workloads deployed
on AWS, starting with common guidance that applies to all failure
modes and followed by specific guidance based on the type of
failure mode.

**Common guidance for all failure
modes**

Consider the following as you design an emergency access process
for a failure mode:

- Document the pre-conditions and assumptions of the process:
when the process should be used and when it should not be
used. It helps to detail the failure mode and document
assumptions, such as the state of other related systems. For
example, the process for the Failure Mode 2 assumes that the identity provider is
available, but the configuration on AWS is modified or has
expired.
- Pre-create resources needed by the emergency access process
([SEC10-BP05](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html)).
For example, pre-create the emergency access AWS account with
IAM users and roles, and the cross-account IAM roles in all
the workload accounts. This verifies that these resources are
ready and available when an emergency event happens. By
pre-creating resources, you do not have a dependency on AWS
[control plane](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/control-planes-and-data-planes.html)
APIs (used to create and modify AWS resources) that may be
unavailable in an emergency. Further, by pre-creating IAM
resources, you do not need to account for
[potential
delays due to eventual consistency.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)
- Include emergency access processes as part of your incident
management plans
([SEC10-BP02](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_develop_management_plans.html)).
Document how emergency events are tracked and communicated to
others in your organization such as peer teams, your
leadership, and, when applicable, externally to your customers
and business partners.
- Define the emergency access request process in your existing
service request workflow system if you have one. Typically,
such workflow systems allow you to create intake forms to
collect information about the request, track the request
through each stage of the workflow, and add both automated and
manual approval steps. Relate each request with a
corresponding emergency event tracked in your incident
management system. Having a uniform system for emergency
accesses allows you to track those requests in a single
system, analyze usage trends, and improve your processes.
- Verify that your emergency access processes can only be
initiated by authorized users and require approvals from the
user's peers or management as appropriate. The approval
process should operate effectively both inside and outside
business hours. Define how requests for approval allow
secondary approvers if the primary approvers are unavailable
and are escalated up your management chain until approved.
- Implement robust logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms
for the emergency access process and mechanisms. Generate
detailed audit logs for all successful and failed attempts to
gain emergency access. Correlate the activity with ongoing
emergency events from your incident management system, and
initiate alerts when actions occur outside of expected time
periods or when the emergency access account is used during
normal operations. The emergency access account should only be
accessed during emergencies, as break-glass procedures can be
considered a backdoor. Integrate with your security
information and event management (SIEM) tool or
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) to report and audit all activities during
the emergency access period. Upon returning to normal
operations, automatically rotate the emergency access
credentials, and notify the relevant teams.
- Test emergency access processes periodically to verify that
the steps are clear and grant the correct level of access
quickly and efficiently. Your emergency access processes
should be tested as part of incident response simulations
([SEC10-BP07](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html))
and disaster recovery tests
([REL13-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_dr_tested.html)).

**Failure Mode 1: Identity provider used to
federate to AWS is unavailable**

As described in
[SEC02-BP04
Rely on a centralized identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html), we recommend
relying on a centralized identity provider to federate your
workforce users to grant access to AWS accounts. You can federate
to multiple AWS accounts in your AWS organization using IAM Identity Center, or you can federate to individual AWS accounts
using IAM. In both cases, workforce users authenticate with
your centralized identity provider before being redirected to an
AWS sign-in endpoint to single sign-on.

In the unlikely event that your centralized identity provider is
unavailable, your workforce users can't federate to AWS accounts
or manage their workloads. In this emergency event, you can
provide an emergency access process for a small set of
administrators to access AWS accounts to perform critical tasks
that cannot wait until your centralized identity providers are
back online. For example, your identity provider is unavailable
for 4 hours and during that period you need to modify the upper
limits of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a Production account to
handle an unexpected spike in customer traffic. Your emergency
administrators should follow the emergency access process to gain
access to the specific production AWS account and make the
necessary changes.

The emergency access process relies on a pre-created emergency
access AWS account that is used solely for emergency access and
has AWS resources (such as IAM roles and IAM users) to support the
emergency access process. During normal operations, no one should
access the emergency access account and you must monitor and alert
on the misuse of this account (for more detail, see the preceding
Common guidance section).

The emergency access account has emergency access IAM roles with
permissions to assume cross-account roles in the AWS accounts that
require emergency access. These IAM roles are pre-created and
configured with trust policies that trust the emergency account's
IAM roles.

The emergency access process can use one of the following
approaches:

- You can pre-create a set of
[IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) for your emergency administrators in the
emergency access account with associated strong passwords and
MFA tokens. These IAM users have permissions to assume the IAM
roles that then allow cross-account access to the AWS account
where emergency access is required. We recommend creating as
few such users as possible and assigning each user to a single
emergency administrator. During an emergency, an emergency
administrator user signs into the emergency access account
using their password and MFA token code, switches to the
emergency access IAM role in the emergency account, and
finally switches to the emergency access IAM role in the
workload account to perform the emergency change action. The
advantage of this approach is that each IAM user is assigned
to one emergency administrator and you can know which user
signed-in by reviewing CloudTrail events. The disadvantage is
that you have to maintain multiple IAM users with their
associated long-lived passwords and MFA tokens.
- You can use the emergency access
[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) to sign into the emergency access
account, assume the IAM role for emergency access, and assume
the cross-account role in the workload account. We recommend
setting a strong password and multiple MFA tokens for the root
user. We also recommend storing the password and the MFA
tokens in a secure enterprise credential vault that enforces
strong authentication and authorization. You should secure the
password and MFA token reset factors: set the email address
for the account to an email distribution list that is
monitored by your cloud security administrators, and the phone
number of the account to a shared phone number that is also
monitored by security administrators. The advantage of this
approach is that there is one set of root user credentials to
manage. The disadvantage is that since this is a shared user,
multiple administrators have ability to sign in as the root
user. You must audit your enterprise vault log events to
identify which administrator checked out the root user
password.

**Failure Mode 2: Identity provider
configuration on AWS is modified or has expired**

To allow your workforce users to federate to AWS accounts, you can
configure the IAM Identity Center with an external identity
provider or create an IAM Identity Provider
([SEC02-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html)).
Typically, you configure these by importing a SAML meta-data XML
document provided by your identity provider. The meta-data XML
document includes a X.509 certificate corresponding to a private
key that the identity provider uses to sign its SAML assertions.

These configurations on the AWS-side may be modified or deleted by
mistake by an administrator. In another scenario, the X.509
certificate imported into AWS may expire and a new meta-data XML
with a new certificate has not yet been imported into AWS. Both
scenarios can break federation to AWS for your workforce users,
resulting in an emergency.

In such an emergency event, you can provide your identity
administrators access to AWS to fix the federation issues. For
example, your identity administrator uses the emergency access
process to sign into the emergency access AWS account, switches to
a role in the Identity Center administrator account, and updates
the external identity provider configuration by importing the
latest SAML meta-data XML document from your identity provider to
re-enable federation. Once federation is fixed, your workforce
users continue to use the normal operating process to federate
into their workload accounts.

You can follow the approaches detailed in the previous Failure
Mode 1 to create an emergency access
process. You can grant least-privilege permissions to your
identity administrators to access only the Identity Center
administrator account and perform actions on Identity Center in
that account.

**Failure Mode 3: Identity Center
disruption**

In the unlikely event of an IAM Identity Center or AWS Region
disruption, we recommend that you set up a configuration that you
can use to provide temporary access to the AWS Management Console.

The emergency access process uses direct federation from your
identity provider to IAM in an emergency account. For detail
on the process and design considerations, see
[Set
up emergency access to the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/emergency-access.html).

### Implementation steps

**Common steps for all failure
modes**

- Create an AWS account dedicated to emergency access
processes. Pre-create the IAM resources needed in the
account such as IAM roles or IAM users, and optionally IAM
Identity Providers. Additionally, pre-create cross-account
IAM roles in the workload AWS accounts with trust
relationships with corresponding IAM roles in the emergency
access account. You can use
[CloudFormation
StackSets with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-cloudformation.html) to create such
resources in the member accounts in your organization.

- Create AWS Organizations
[service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCPs) to deny the deletion and
modification of the cross-account IAM roles in the member
AWS accounts.
- Enable CloudTrail for the emergency access AWS account and
send the trail events to a central S3 bucket in your log
collection AWS account. If you are using AWS Control Tower
to set up and govern your AWS multi-account environment,
then every account you create using AWS Control Tower or enroll
in AWS Control Tower has CloudTrail enabled by default and sent
to an S3 bucket in a dedicated log archive AWS account.
- Monitor the emergency access account for activity by
creating EventBridge rules that match on console login and
API activity by the emergency IAM roles. Send notifications
to your security operations center when activity happens
outside of an ongoing emergency event tracked in your
incident management system.

**Additional steps for Failure Mode 1:
Identity provider used to federate to AWS is unavailable and
Failure Mode 2: Identity provider configuration on AWS is
modified or has expired**

- Pre-create resources depending on the mechanism you choose
for emergency access:

**Using IAM users:**
pre-create the IAM users with strong passwords and
associated MFA devices.
- **Using the emergency account root
user:** configure the root user with a strong
password and store the password in your enterprise
credential vault. Associate multiple physical MFA
devices with the root user and store the devices in
locations that can be accessed quickly by members of
your emergency administrator team.

**Additional steps for Failure Mode 3:
Identity center disruption**

- As detailed in
[Set
up emergency access to the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/emergency-access.html), in
the emergency access AWS account, create an IAM Identity
Provider to enable direct SAML federation from your identity
provider.
- Create emergency operations groups in your IdP with no
members.
- Create IAM roles corresponding to the emergency operations
groups in the emergency access account.

# SEC03-BP04 Reduce permissions continuously

As your teams determine what access is required, remove unneeded permissions and establish review processes to achieve least privilege permissions. Continually monitor and remove unused identities and permissions for both human and machine access.

**Desired outcome:** Permission policies should adhere to the least privilege principle. As job duties and roles become better defined, your permission policies need to be reviewed to remove unnecessary permissions. This approach lessens the scope of impact should credentials be inadvertently exposed or otherwise accessed without authorization.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Defaulting to granting users administrator permissions.
- Creating policies that are overly permissive, but without full administrator privileges.
- Keeping permission policies after they are no longer needed.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

As teams and projects are just getting started, permissive permission policies might be used to inspire innovation and agility. For example, in a development or test environment, developers can be given access to a broad set of AWS services. We recommend that you evaluate access continuously and restrict access to only those services and service actions that are necessary to complete the current job. We recommend this evaluation for both human and machine identities. Machine identities, sometimes called system or service accounts, are identities that give AWS access to applications or servers. This access is especially important in a production environment, where overly permissive permissions can have a broad impact and potentially expose customer data.

AWS provides multiple methods to help identify unused users, roles, permissions, and credentials. AWS can also help analyze access activity of IAM users and roles, including associated access keys, and access to AWS resources such as objects in Amazon S3 buckets. AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer policy generation can assist you in creating restrictive permission policies based on the actual services and actions a principal interacts with. [Attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) can help simplify permissions management, as you can provide permissions to users using their attributes instead of attaching permissions policies directly to each user.

### Implementation steps

- **Use [AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html):** IAM Access Analyzer helps identify resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets or IAM roles that are [shared with an external entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-getting-started.html).
- **Use [IAM Access Analyzer policy generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html):** IAM Access Analyzer policy generation helps you [create fine-grained permission policies based on an IAM user or role’s access activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html#access-analyzer-policy-generation-howitworks).
- **Test permissions across lower
environments before production:** Start by using
the
[less
critical sandbox and development environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/choosing-git-branch-approach/understanding-the-devops-environments.html) to test
the permissions required for various job functions using IAM Access Analyzer. Then, progressively tighten and validate
these permissions across the testing, quality assurance, and
staging environments before applying them to production. The
lower environments can have more relaxed permissions
initially, as service control policies (SCPs) enforce
guardrails by limiting the maximum permissions granted.
- **Determine an acceptable timeframe and usage policy for IAM users and roles:** Use the [last accessed timestamp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor-view-data.html) to [identify unused users and roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/identify-unused-iam-roles-remove-confidently-last-used-timestamp/) and remove them. Review service and action last accessed information to identify and [scope permissions for specific users and roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html). For example, you can use last accessed information to identify the specific Amazon S3 actions that your application role requires and restrict the role’s access to only those actions. Last accessed information features are available in the AWS Management Console and programmatically allow you to incorporate them into your infrastructure workflows and automated tools.
- **Consider [logging data events in AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html):** By default, CloudTrail does not log data events such as Amazon S3 object-level activity (for example, `GetObject` and `DeleteObject`) or Amazon DynamoDB table activities (for example, `PutItem` and `DeleteItem`). Consider using logging for these events to determine what users and roles need access to specific Amazon S3 objects or DynamoDB table items.

# SEC03-BP05 Define permission guardrails for your organization

Use permission guardrails to reduce the scope of available
permissions that can be granted to principals. The permission policy
evaluation chain includes your guardrails to determine the
*effective permissions* of a principal when
making authorization decisions.  You can define guardrails using a
layer-based approach. Apply some guardrails broadly across your
entire organization and apply others granularly to temporary access
sessions.

**Desired outcome:** You have clear
isolation of environments using separate AWS accounts.  Service
control policies (SCPs) are used to define organization-wide
permission guardrails. Broader guardrails are set at the hierarchy
levels closest to your organization root, and more strict guardrails
are set closer to the level of individual accounts.

Where supported, resource policies define the conditions that a
principal must satisfy to gain access to a resource. Resource
policies also scope down the set of allowable actions, where
appropriate. Permission boundaries are placed on principals that
manage workload permissions, delegating permission management to
individual workload owners.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Creating member AWS accounts within an
[AWS Organization](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/), but not using SCPs to restrict the use and
permissions available to their root credentials.
- Assigning permissions based on least privilege, but not placing
guardrails on the maximum set of permissions that can be
granted.
- Relying on the *implicit deny* foundation of
AWS IAM to restrict permissions, trusting that policies will not
grant an undesired *explicit
allow* permission.
- Running multiple workload environments in the same AWS account,
and then relying on mechanisms such as VPCs, tags, or resource
policies to enforce permission boundaries.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Permission guardrails help build confidence
that undesired permissions cannot be granted, even when a permission
policy attempts to do so.  This can simplify defining and managing
permissions by reducing the maximum scope of permissions needing
consideration.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

We recommend you use a layer-based approach to define permission
guardrails for your organization. This approach systematically
reduces the maximum set of possible permissions as additional
layers are applied. This helps you grant access based on the
principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of unintended
access due to policy misconfiguration.

The first step to establish permission guardrails is to isolate
your workloads and environments into separate AWS accounts.
Principals from one account cannot access resources in another
account without explicit permission to do so, even when both
accounts are in the same AWS organization or under the same
[organizational
unit (OU)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html). You can use OUs to group accounts you want to
administer as a single unit.

The next step is to reduce the maximum set of permissions that you
can grant to principals within the member accounts of your
organization. You can
use [service
control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) for this purpose, which you can
apply to either an OU or an account. SCPs can enforce common
access controls, such as restricting access to specific AWS Regions, help prevent resources from being deleted, or disabling
potentially risky service actions. SCPs that you apply to the root
of your organization only affect its member accounts, not the
management account.  SCPs only govern the principals within your
organization. Your SCPs don't govern principals outside your
organization that are accessing your resources.

If you are using
[AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html), you can leverage its
[controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/how-control-tower-works.html#how-controls-work)
and
[landing
zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.html) as the foundation for your permission guardrails and
multi-account environment. The landing zones provide a
pre-configured, secure baseline environment with separate accounts
for different workloads and applications. The guardrails enforce
mandatory controls around security, operations, and compliance
through a combination of Service Control Policies (SCPs), AWS Config rules, and other configurations. However, when using
Control Tower guardrails and landing zones alongside custom
Organization SCPs, it's crucial to follow the best practices
outlined in the AWS documentation to avoid conflicts and ensure
proper governance. Refer to the
[AWS Control Tower guidance for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/orgs-guidance.html) for detailed
recommendations on managing SCPs, accounts, and organizational
units (OUs) within a Control Tower environment.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively leverage
Control Tower's guardrails, landing zones, and custom SCPs while
mitigating potential conflicts and ensuring proper governance and
control over your multi-account AWS environment.

A further step is to use
[IAM
resource policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based) to scope the available actions that you
can take on the resources they govern, along with any conditions
that the acting principal must meet. This can be as broad as
allowing all actions so long as the principal is part of your
organization (using the
PrincipalOrgId [condition
key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html)), or as granular as only allowing specific actions by a
specific IAM role. You can take a similar approach with conditions
in IAM role trust policies.  If a resource or role trust policy
explicitly names a principal in the same account as the role or
resource it governs, that principal does not need an attached IAM
policy that grants the same permissions.  If the principal is in a
different account from the resource, then the principal does need
an attached IAM policy that grants those permissions.

Often, a workload team will want to manage the permissions their
workload requires.  This may require them to create new IAM roles
and permission policies.  You can capture the maximum scope of
permissions the team is allowed to grant in an
[IAM
permission boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html), and associate this document to an IAM
role the team can then use to manage their IAM roles and
permissions.  This approach can provide them the flexibility to
complete their work while mitigating risks of having IAM
administrative access.

A more granular step is to implement *privileged access
management* (PAM) and *temporary elevated
access management* (TEAM) techniques.  One example of
PAM is to require principals to perform multi-factor
authentication before taking privileged actions.  For more
information, see
[Configuring
MFA-protected API access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html). TEAM requires a solution that
manages the approval and timeframe that a principal is allowed to
have elevated access.  One approach is to temporarily add the
principal to the role trust policy for an IAM role that has
elevated access.  Another approach is to, under normal operation,
scope down the permissions granted to a principal by an IAM role
using a
[session
policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session), and then temporarily lift this restriction during
the approved time window. To learn more about solutions that AWS
and select partners validated, see
[Temporary
elevated access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/temporary-elevated-access.html).

### Implementation steps

- Isolate your workloads and environments into separate AWS accounts.
- Use SCPs to reduce the maximum set of permissions that can
be granted to principals within the member accounts of your
organization.

When defining SCPs to reduce the maximum set of
permissions that can be granted to principals within
your organization's member accounts, you can choose
between an *allow list* or
*deny list* approach. The allow list
strategy explicitly specifies the access that is allowed
and implicitly blocks all other access. The deny list
strategy explicitly specifies the access that isn't
allowed and allows all other access by default. Both
strategies have their advantages and trade-offs, and the
appropriate choice depends on your organization's
specific requirements and risk model. For more detail,
see
[Strategy
for using SCPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_strategies.html).
- Additionally, review the
[service
control policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html) to understand how to
construct SCPs effectively.

- Use IAM resource policies to scope down and specify
conditions for permitted actions on resources.  Use
conditions in IAM role trust policies to create restrictions
on assuming roles.
- Assign IAM permission boundaries to IAM roles that workload
teams can then use to manage their own workload IAM roles
and permissions.
- Evaluate PAM and TEAM solutions based on your needs.

# SEC03-BP06 Manage access based on lifecycle

Monitor and adjust the permissions granted to your principals
(users, roles, and groups) throughout their lifecycle within your
organization. Adjust group memberships as users change roles, and
remove access when a user leaves the organization.

**Desired outcome:** You monitor and
adjust permissions throughout the lifecycle of principals within the
organization, reducing risk of unnecessary privileges. You grant
appropriate access when you create a user. You modify access as the
user's responsibilities change, and you remove access when the user
is no longer active or has left the organization. You centrally
manage changes to your users, roles, and groups. You use automation
to propagate changes to your AWS environments.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Granting excessive or broad access privileges to identities
upfront, beyond what is initially required.
- Not reviewing and adjusting access privileges as identities'
roles and responsibilities change over time.
- Leaving inactive or terminated identities with active access
privileges. This increases the risk of unauthorized access.
- Not leveraging automation to manage the lifecycle of identities.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Carefully manage and adjust access privileges that you grant to
identities (such as users, roles, groups) throughout their
lifecycle. This lifecycle includes the initial onboarding phase,
ongoing changes in roles and responsibilities, and eventual
offboarding or termination. Proactively manage access based on the
stage of the lifecycle to maintain the appropriate access level.
Adhere to the principle of least privilege to reduce the risk of
excessive or unnecessary access Privileges.

You can manage the lifecycle of IAM users directly within the AWS account, or through federation from your workforce identity
provider to
[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/). For IAM users, you can create, modify,
and delete users and their associated permissions within the AWS account. For federated users, you can use IAM Identity Center to
manage their lifecycle by synchronizing user and group information
from your organization's identity provider using the
[System
for Cross-domain Identity Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html) (SCIM) protocol.

SCIM is an open standard protocol for automated provisioning and
deprovisioning of user identities across different systems. By
integrating your identity provider with IAM Identity Center using
SCIM, you can automatically synchronize user and group
information, helping to validate that access privileges are
granted, modified, or revoked based on changes in your
organization's authoritative identity source.

As the roles and responsibilities of employees change within your
organization, adjust their access privileges accordingly. You can
use IAM Identity Center's permission sets to define different job
roles or responsibilities and associate them with the appropriate
IAM policies and permissions. When an employee's role changes, you
can update their assigned permission set to reflect their new
responsibilities. Verify that they have the necessary access while
adhering to the principle of least privilege.

### Implementation steps

- Define and document an access management lifecycle process,
including procedures for granting initial access, periodic
reviews, and offboarding.
- Implement
[IAM
roles, groups, and permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) to manage
access collectively and enforce maximum permissible access
levels.
- Integrate with a
[federated
identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html) (such as Microsoft Active
Directory, Okta, Ping Identity) as the authoritative source
for user and group information using IAM Identity Center.
- Use the
[SCIM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html)
protocol to synchronize user and group information from the
identity provider into IAM Identity Center's Identity Store.
- Create
[permission
sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html) in IAM Identity Center that represent different
job roles or responsibilities within your organization.
Define the appropriate IAM policies and permissions for each
permission set.
- Implement regular access reviews, prompt access revocation,
and continuous improvement of the access management
lifecycle process.
- Provide training and awareness to employees on access
management best practices.

# SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and cross-account access

Continually monitor findings that highlight public and cross-account access. Reduce public access and cross-account access to only the specific resources that require this access.

**Desired outcome:** Know which of your AWS resources are shared and with whom. Continually monitor and audit your shared resources to verify they are shared with only authorized principals.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not keeping an inventory of shared resources.
- Not following a process for approval of cross-account or public access to resources.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

If your account is in AWS Organizations, you can grant access to resources to the entire organization, specific organizational units, or individual accounts. If your account is not a member of an organization, you can share resources with individual accounts. You can grant direct cross-account access using resource-based policies — for example, [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html) — or by allowing a principal in another account to assume an IAM role in your account. When using resource policies, verify that access is only granted to authorized principals. Define a process to approve all resources which are required to be publicly available.

[AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/) uses [provable security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/) to identify all access paths to a resource from outside of its account. It reviews resource policies continuously, and reports findings of public and cross-account access to make it simple for you to analyze potentially broad access. Consider configuring IAM Access Analyzer with AWS Organizations to verify that you have visibility to all your accounts. IAM Access Analyzer also allows you to [preview findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-access-preview.html) before deploying resource permissions. This allows you to validate that your policy changes grant only the intended public and cross-account access to your resources. When designing for multi-account access, you can use [trust policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) to control in what cases a role can be assumed. For example, you could use the [PrincipalOrgId condition key to deny an attempt to assume a role from outside your AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/).

[AWS Config can report resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/operational-best-practices-for-Publicly-Accessible-Resources.html) that are misconfigured, and
through AWS Config policy checks, can detect resources that have
public access configured. Services such as
[AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/) and
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html) simplify deploying detective controls and
guardrails across AWS Organizations to identify and remediate
publicly exposed resources. For example, AWS Control Tower has a
managed guardrail which can detect if any
[Amazon EBS snapshots are restorable by AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html).

### Implementation steps

- **Consider using [AWS Config for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-config.html):** AWS Config allows you to aggregate findings from multiple accounts within an AWS Organizations to a delegated administrator account. This provides a comprehensive view, and allows you to [deploy AWS Config Rules across accounts to detect publicly accessible resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html).
- **Configure AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer:** IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles that are [shared with an external entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-getting-started.html).
- **Use auto-remediation in AWS Config to respond to changes in public access configuration of Amazon S3 buckets:** [You can automatically turn on the block public access settings for Amazon S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-config-to-monitor-for-and-respond-to-amazon-s3-buckets-allowing-public-access/).
- **Implement monitoring and alerting to
identify if Amazon S3 buckets have become public:**
You must have
[monitoring
and alerting](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-cloudtrail-integration/) in place to identify when Amazon S3
Block Public Access is turned off, and if Amazon S3 buckets
become public. Additionally, if you are using AWS Organizations, you can create a
[service
control policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) that prevents changes to Amazon S3
public access policies.
[AWS Trusted Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/trusted-advisor.html) checks for Amazon S3 buckets that
have open access permissions. Bucket permissions that grant,
upload, or delete access to everyone create potential
security issues by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove
items in a bucket. The Trusted Advisor check examines
explicit bucket permissions and associated bucket policies
that might override the bucket permissions. You also can use
AWS Config to monitor your Amazon S3 buckets for public
access. For more information, see
[How
to Use AWS Config to Monitor for and Respond to Amazon S3
Buckets Allowing Public Access](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-config-to-monitor-for-and-respond-to-amazon-s3-buckets-allowing-public-access/).

When reviewing access controls for Amazon S3 buckets, it is
important to consider the nature of the data stored within them.
[Amazon Macie](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/findings-types.html) is a service designed to help you discover and
protect sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable
Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and
credentials like private keys or AWS access keys.

# SEC03-BP08 Share resources securely within your organization

As the number of workloads grows, you might need to share access to resources in those workloads or provision
the resources multiple times across multiple accounts. You might have constructs to compartmentalize your
environment, such as having development, testing, and production environments. However, having separation
constructs does not limit you from being able to share securely. By sharing components that overlap, you
can reduce operational overhead and allow for a consistent experience without guessing what you might have
missed while creating the same resource multiple times.

**Desired outcome:** Minimize unintended access by using secure methods to share
resources within your organization, and help with your data loss prevention initiative. Reduce your
operational overhead compared to managing individual components, reduce errors from manually creating
the same component multiple times, and increase your workloads’ scalability. You can benefit from decreased
time to resolution in multi-point failure scenarios, and increase your confidence in determining when a
component is no longer needed. For prescriptive guidance on analyzing externally shared resources,
see [SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and cross-account access](./sec_permissions_analyze_cross_account.html).

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Lack of process to continually monitor and automatically alert on unexpected external share.
- Lack of baseline on what should be shared and what should not.
- Defaulting to a broadly open policy rather than sharing explicitly when required.
- Manually creating foundational resources that overlap when required.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Architect your access controls and patterns to govern the consumption of shared resources securely and
only with trusted entities. Monitor shared resources and review shared resource access continuously,
and be alerted on inappropriate or unexpected sharing. Review
[Analyze public and cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_analyze_cross_account.html)
to help you establish governance to reduce the external access to only resources that require it, and to
establish a process to monitor continuously and alert automatically.

Cross-account sharing within AWS Organizations is supported by [a number of AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html),
such as [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-securityhub.html),
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html),
and [AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-backup.html).
These services allow for data to be shared to a central account, be accessible from a central account, or manage resources
and data from a central account. For example, AWS Security Hub CSPM can transfer findings from individual accounts to a
central account where you can view all the findings. AWS Backup can take a backup for a resource and share it
across accounts. You can use [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/ram/) (AWS RAM) to share other
common resources, such as [VPC subnets and Transit Gateway attachments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html#shareable-vpc),
[AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html#shareable-network-firewall),
or [Amazon SageMaker AI pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html#shareable-sagemaker).

To restrict your account to only share resources within your organization, use
[service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/scp.html)
to prevent access to external principals. When sharing resources, combine identity-based controls and
network controls to [create a data perimeter for your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-a-data-perimeter-on-aws/building-a-data-perimeter-on-aws.html)
to help protect against unintended access. A data perimeter is a set of preventive guardrails to help verify
that only your trusted identities are accessing trusted resources from expected networks. These controls place
appropriate limits on what resources can be shared and prevent sharing or exposing resources that should not be
allowed. For example, as a part of your data perimeter, you can use VPC endpoint policies and the
`AWS:PrincipalOrgId` condition to ensure the identities accessing your Amazon S3 buckets
belong to your organization. It is important to note that
[SCPs do not apply to service-linked roles or AWS service principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html#scp-effects-on-permissions).

When using Amazon S3,
[turn off ACLs for your Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html)
and use IAM policies to define access control. For [restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html)
from [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), migrate from origin access identity (OAI) to origin access
control (OAC) which supports additional features including server-side encryption with
[AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

In some cases, you might want to allow sharing resources outside of your organization or grant a third party
access to your resources. For prescriptive guidance on managing permissions to share resources externally,
see [Permissions management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html).

### Implementation steps

- **Use AWS Organizations:** AWS Organizations is an account management service that allows you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts
into an organization that you create and centrally manage. You can group your accounts into
organizational units (OUs) and attach different policies to each OU to help you meet your
budgetary, security, and compliance needs. You can also control how AWS artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) services can collect and store data, and use the multi-account management of
the AWS services integrated with Organizations.
- **Integrate AWS Organizations with AWS services:** When you use an AWS service to perform tasks on your behalf in the member accounts of your organization,
AWS Organizations creates an IAM service-linked role (SLR) for that service in each member account. You should
manage trusted access using the AWS Management Console, the AWS APIs, or the AWS CLI. For prescriptive guidance on
turning on trusted access, see [Using AWS Organizations with other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html)
and [AWS services
that you can use with Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html).
- **Establish a data
perimeter:** A data perimeter provides a clear
boundary of trust and ownership. On AWS, it is typically
represented as your AWS organization managed by AWS Organizations, along with any on-premises networks or
systems that access your AWS resources. The goal of the data
perimeter is to verify that access is allowed if the
identity is trusted, the resource is trusted, and the
network is expected. However, establishing a data perimeter
is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Evaluate and adopt the
control objectives outlined in the
[Building
a Perimeter on AWS whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-a-data-perimeter-on-aws/welcome.html) based on your specific
security risk models and requirements. You should carefully
consider your unique risk posture and implement the
perimeter controls that align with your security needs.
- **Use resource sharing in AWS services and restrict accordingly:** Many AWS services allow you to share resources with another account, or target a resource in another
account, such as [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)
and [AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html).
Restrict the `ModifyImageAttribute` API to specify the trusted accounts to share the AMI with.
Specify the `ram:RequestedAllowsExternalPrincipals` condition when using AWS RAM to constrain sharing
to your organization only, to help prevent access from untrusted identities. For prescriptive guidance and
considerations, see [Resource sharing and external targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-a-data-perimeter-on-aws/perimeter-implementation.html).
- **Use AWS RAM to share securely in an account or with other AWS accounts:** [AWS RAM](https://aws.amazon.com/ram/) helps you securely share the resources that you have
created with roles and users in your account and with other AWS accounts. In a multi-account
environment, AWS RAM allows you to create a resource once and share it with other accounts. This
approach helps reduce your operational overhead while providing consistency, visibility, and
auditability through integrations with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail, which you do not receive when
using cross-account access.

If you have resources that you shared previously using a resource-based policy, you can use the
[PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.html)
or an equivalent to promote the resource share to a full AWS RAM resource share.

In some cases, you might need to take additional steps to share resources. For example,
to share an encrypted snapshot, you need to [share a AWS KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.html#share-kms-key).

# SEC03-BP09 Share resources securely with a third party

The security of your cloud environment doesn't stop at your
organization. Your organization might rely on a third party to
manage a portion of your data. The permission management for the
third-party managed system should follow the practice of
just-in-time access using the principle of least privilege with
temporary credentials. By working closely with a third party, you
can reduce the scope of impact and risk of unintended access
together.

**Desired outcome:** You avoid using
long-term AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials like
access keys and secret keys, as they pose a security risk if
misused. Instead, you use IAM roles and temporary credentials to
improve your security posture and minimize the operational overhead
of managing long-term credentials. When granting third-party access,
you use a universally unique identifier (UUID) as the external ID in
the IAM trust policy and keep the IAM policies attached to the role
under your control to ensure least privilege access. For
prescriptive guidance on analyzing externally shared resources, see
[SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and
cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_analyze_cross_account.html).

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using the default IAM trust policy without any conditions.
- Using long-term IAM credentials and access keys.
- Reusing external IDs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

You might want to allow sharing resources outside of AWS Organizations or grant a third party access to your account. For
example, a third party might provide a monitoring solution that
needs to access resources within your account. In those cases,
create an IAM cross-account role with only the privileges needed
by the third party. Additionally, define a trust policy using the
[external
ID condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html). When using an external ID, you or the third
party can generate a unique ID for each customer, third party, or
tenancy. The unique ID should not be controlled by anyone but you
after it's created. The third party must implement a process to
relate the external ID to the customer in a secure, auditable, and
reproduceable manner.

You can also use
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to manage IAM roles for applications outside
of AWS that use AWS APIs.

If the third party no longer requires access to your environment,
remove the role. Avoid providing long-term credentials to a third
party. Maintain awareness of other AWS services that support
sharing, such as the AWS Well-Architected Tool allowing
[sharing
a workload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/workloads-sharing.html) with other AWS accounts, and
[AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) helping you securely share an AWS
resource you own with other accounts.

### Implementation steps

- **Use cross-account roles to provide
access to external accounts.**
[Cross-account
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) reduce the amount of sensitive information that
is stored by external accounts and third parties for
servicing their customers. Cross-account roles allow you to
grant access to AWS resources in your account securely to a
third party, such as AWS Partners or other accounts in your
organization, while maintaining the ability to manage and
audit that access. The third party might be providing
service to you from a hybrid infrastructure or alternatively
pulling data into an offsite location.
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) helps you allow third-party workloads
to securely interact with your AWS workloads and further
reduce the need for long-term credentials.

You should not use long-term credentials or access keys
associated with users to provide external account access.
Instead, use cross-account roles to provide the
cross-account access.
- **Perform due diligence and ensure
secure access for third-party SaaS providers.**
When sharing resources with third-party SaaS providers,
perform thorough due diligence to ensure they have a secure
and responsible approach to accessing your AWS resources.
Evaluate their shared responsibility model to understand
what security measures they provide and what falls under
your responsibility. Ensure that the SaaS provider has a
secure and auditable process for accessing your resources,
including the use of
[external
IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and least privilege access principles. The use of
external IDs helps address the
[confused
deputy problem](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-external-id-when-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources/).

Implement security controls to ensure secure access and
adherence to the principle of least privilege when granting
access to third-party SaaS providers. This may include the
use of external IDs, universally unique identifiers (UUIDs),
and IAM trust policies that limit access to only what is
strictly necessary. Work closely with the SaaS provider to
establish secure access mechanisms, regularly review their
access to your AWS resources, and conduct audits to ensure
compliance with your security requirements.
- **Deprecate customer-provided
long-term credentials.** Deprecate the use of
long-term credentials and use cross-account roles or IAM
Roles Anywhere. If you must use long-term credentials,
establish a plan to migrate to role-based access. For
details on managing keys, see
[Identity
management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/identity-management.html). Also, work with your AWS account team and
the third party to establish a risk mitigation runbook. For
prescriptive guidance on responding to and mitigating the
potential impact of a security incident, see
[Incident
response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/incident-response.html).
- **Verify that setup has prescriptive
guidance or is automated.** The external ID is not
treated as a secret, but the external ID must not be an
easily guessable value, such as a phone number, name, or
account ID. Make the external ID a read-only field so that
the external ID cannot be changed for the purpose of
impersonating the setup.

You or the third party can generate the external ID. Define
a process to determine who is responsible for generating the
ID. Regardless of the entity creating the external ID, the
third party enforces uniqueness and formats consistently
across customers.

The policy created for cross-account access in your accounts
must follow the
[least-privilege
principle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). The third party must provide a role policy
document or automated setup mechanism that uses an AWS CloudFormation template or an equivalent for you. This
reduces the chance of errors associated with manual policy
creation and offers an auditable trail. For more information
on using an AWS CloudFormation template to create
cross-account roles, see
[Cross-Account
Roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/tag/cross-account-roles/).

The third party should provide an automated, auditable setup
mechanism. However, by using the role policy document
outlining the access needed, you should automate the setup
of the role. Using an AWS CloudFormation template or
equivalent, you should monitor for changes with drift
detection as part of the audit practice.
- **Account for changes.** Your
account structure, your need for the third party, or their
service offering being provided might change. You should
anticipate changes and failures, and plan accordingly with
the right people, process, and technology. Audit the level
of access you provide on a periodic basis, and implement
detection methods to alert you to unexpected changes.
Monitor and audit the use of the role and the datastore of
the external IDs. You should be prepared to revoke
third-party access, either temporarily or permanently, as a
result of unexpected changes or access patterns. Also,
measure the impact to your revocation operation, including
the time it takes to perform, the people involved, the cost,
and the impact to other resources.

For prescriptive guidance on detection methods, see the
[Detection best
practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/detection.html).

## Question SEC04

# SEC 4 — How do you detect and investigate security events?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# SEC04-BP01 Configure service and application logging

Retain security event logs from services and applications. This is a fundamental principle of security for audit, investigations, and operational use cases, and a common security requirement driven by governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) standards, policies, and procedures.

**Desired outcome:** An organization should be able to reliably and consistently retrieve security event logs from AWS services and applications in a timely manner when required to fulfill an internal process or obligation, such as a security incident response. Consider centralizing logs for better operational results.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Logs are stored in perpetuity or deleted too soon.
- Everybody can access logs.
- Relying entirely on manual processes for log governance and use.
- Storing every single type of log just in case it is needed.
- Checking log integrity only when necessary.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Implement a root cause analysis (RCA) mechanism for security incidents and a source of evidence for your governance, risk, and compliance obligations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

During a security investigation or other use cases based on your requirements, you need to be able to review relevant logs to record and understand the full scope and timeline of the incident. Logs are also required for alert generation, indicating that certain actions of interest have happened. It is critical to select, turn on, store, and set up querying and retrieval mechanisms and alerting.

**Implementation steps**

- **Select and use log sources.** Ahead of a security investigation, you need to capture relevant logs to retroactively reconstruct activity in an AWS account. Select log sources relevant to your workloads.

The log source selection criteria should be based on the use cases required by your business. Establish a trail for each AWS account using AWS CloudTrail or an AWS Organizations trail, and configure an Amazon S3 bucket for it.

AWS CloudTrail is a logging service that tracks API calls made against an AWS account capturing AWS service activity. It’s turned on by default with a 90-day retention of management events that can be [retrieved through CloudTrail Event history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html) using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK. For longer retention and visibility of data events, [create a CloudTrail trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html) and associate it with an Amazon S3 bucket, and optionally with a Amazon CloudWatch log group. Alternatively, you can create a [CloudTrail Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake.html), which retains CloudTrail logs for up to seven years and provides a SQL-based querying facility

AWS recommends that customers using a VPC turn on network traﬃc and DNS logs using [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) and [Amazon Route 53 resolver query logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logs.html), respectively, and streaming them to either an Amazon S3 bucket or a CloudWatch log group. You can create a VPC ﬂow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. For VPC Flow Logs, you can be selective on how and where you use Flow Logs to reduce cost.

AWS CloudTrail Logs, VPC Flow Logs, and Route 53 resolver query logs are the basic logging sources to support security investigations in AWS. You can also use [Amazon Security Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/what-is-security-lake.html) to collect, normalize, and store this log data in Apache Parquet format and Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), which is ready for querying. Security Lake also supports other AWS logs and logs from third-party sources.

AWS services can generate logs not captured by the basic log sources, such as Elastic Load Balancing logs, AWS WAF logs, AWS Config recorder logs, Amazon GuardDuty ﬁndings, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) audit logs, and Amazon EC2 instance operating system and application logs. For a full list of logging and monitoring options, see [Appendix A: Cloud capability deﬁnitions – Logging and Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/logging-and-events.html) of the [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/detection.html).
- **Research logging capabilities for each AWS service and application:** Each AWS service and application provides you with options for log storage, each of which with its own retention and life-cycle capabilities. The two most common log storage services are Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon CloudWatch. For long retention periods, it is recommended to use Amazon S3 for its cost effectiveness and flexible lifecycle capabilities. If the primary logging option is Amazon CloudWatch Logs, as an option, you should consider archiving less frequently accessed logs to Amazon S3.
- **Select log storage:** The choice of log storage is generally related to which querying tool you use, retention capabilities, familiarity, and cost. The main options for log storage are an Amazon S3 bucket or a CloudWatch Log group.

An Amazon S3 bucket provides cost-eﬀective, durable storage with an optional lifecycle policy. Logs stored in Amazon S3 buckets can be queried using services such as Amazon Athena.

A CloudWatch log group provides durable storage and a built-in query facility through CloudWatch Logs Insights.
- **Identify appropriate log retention:** When you use an Amazon S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group to store logs, you must establish adequate lifecycles for each log source to optimize storage and retrieval costs. Customers generally have between three months to one year of logs readily available for querying, with retention of up to seven years. The choice of availability and retention should align with your security requirements and a composite of statutory, regulatory, and business mandates.
- **Use logging for each AWS service and application with proper retention and lifecycle policies:** For each AWS service or application in your organization, look for the specific logging configuration guidance:

- [Configure Amazon CloudWatch agent for Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html)

- **Select and implement querying mechanisms for logs:** For log queries, you can use [CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) for data stored in CloudWatch log groups, and [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) for data stored in Amazon S3. You can also use third-party querying tools such as a security information and event management (SIEM) service.

The process for selecting a log querying tool should consider the people, process, and technology aspects of your security operations. Select a tool that fulﬁlls operational, business, and security requirements, and is both accessible and maintainable in the long term. Keep in mind that log querying tools work optimally when the number of logs to be scanned is kept within the tool’s limits. It is not uncommon to have multiple querying tools because of cost or technical constraints.

For example, you might use a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) tool to perform queries for the last 90 days of data, but use Athena to perform queries beyond 90 days because of the log ingestion cost of a SIEM. Regardless of the implementation, verify that your approach minimizes the number of tools required to maximize operational eﬃciency, especially during a security event investigation.
- **Use logs for alerting:** AWS provides alerting through several security services:

[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation and remediation against desired configurations.
- [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) is a threat detection service that continually monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads. GuardDuty ingests, aggregates, and analyzes information from sources, such as AWS CloudTrail management and data events, DNS logs, VPC Flow Logs, and Amazon EKS Audit logs. GuardDuty pulls independent data streams directly from CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, DNS query logs, and Amazon EKS. You don’t have to manage Amazon S3 bucket policies or modify the way you collect and store logs. It is still recommended to retain these logs for your own investigation and compliance purposes.
- [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) provides a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts or findings from multiple AWS services and optional third-party products to give you a comprehensive view of security alerts and compliance status.

You can also use custom alert generation engines for security alerts not covered by these services or for speciﬁc alerts relevant to your environment. For information on building these alerts and detections, see [Detection in the AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/detection.html).

# SEC04-BP02 Capture logs, findings, and metrics in standardized locations

Security teams rely on logs and findings to analyze events that may
indicate unauthorized activity or unintentional changes. To
streamline this analysis, capture security logs and findings in
standardized locations.  This makes data points of interest
available for correlation and can simplify tool integrations.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
standardized approach to collect, analyze, and visualize log data,
findings, and metrics. Security teams can efficiently correlate,
analyze, and visualize security data across disparate systems to
discover potential security events and identify anomalies. Security
information and event management (SIEM) systems or other mechanisms
are integrated to query and analyze log data for timely responses,
tracking, and escalation of security events.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Teams independently own and manage logging and metrics
collection that is inconsistent to the organization's logging
strategy.
- Teams don't have adequate access controls to restrict visibility
and alteration of the data collected.
- Teams don't govern their security logs, findings, and metrics as
part of their data classification policy.
- Teams neglect data sovereignty and localization requirements
when configuring data collections.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** A standardized logging solution to collect and
query log data and events improves insights derived from the
information they contain. Configuring an automated lifecycle for the
collected log data can reduce the costs incurred by log storage. You
can build fine-grained access control for the collected log
information according to the sensitivity of the data and access
patterns needed by your teams. You can integrate tooling to
correlate, visualize, and derive insights from the data.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Growth in AWS usage within an organization results in a growing
number of distributed workloads and environments. As each of these
workloads and environments generate data about the activity within
them, capturing and storing this data locally presents a challenge
for security operations. Security teams use tools such as security
information and event management (SIEM) systems to collect data
from distributed sources and undergo correlation, analysis, and
response workflows. This requires managing a complex set of
permissions for accessing the various data sources and additional
overhead in operating the extraction, transformation, and loading
(ETL) processes.

To overcome these challenges, consider aggregating all relevant
sources of security log data into a
Log Archive account as described in
[Organizing
Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/security-ou-and-accounts.html#log-archive-account). This includes
all security-related data from your workload and logs that AWS
services generate, such as
[AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/),
[AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/),
[Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), and
[Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). There are several benefits to capturing this data in
standardized locations in a separate AWS account with proper
cross-account permissions. This practice helps prevent log
tampering within compromised workloads and environments, provides
a single integration point for additional tools, and offers a more
simplified model for configuring data retention and lifecycle.
Evaluate the impacts of data sovereignty, compliance scopes, and
other regulations to determine if multiple security data storage
locations and retention periods are required.

To ease capturing and standardizing logs and findings, evaluate
[Amazon
Security Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/what-is-security-lake.html) in your Log Archive account. You can
configure Security Lake to automatically ingest data from common
sources such as CloudTrail, Route 53,
[Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),
and
[VPC
Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html). You can also configure AWS Security Hub CSPM as a
data source into Security Lake, allowing you to correlate findings
from other AWS services, such as
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) and
[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/), with your log data.  You can also use
third-party data source integrations, or configure custom data
sources. All integrations standardize your data into the
[Open Cybersecurity
Schema Framework](https://github.com/ocsf) (OCSF) format, and are stored in
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
buckets as Parquet files, eliminating the need for ETL processing.

Storing security data in standardized locations provides advanced
analytics capabilities.  AWS recommends you deploy tools for
security analytics that operate in an AWS environment into a
[Security
Tooling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/security-ou-and-accounts.html#security-tooling-accounts) account that is separate from your Log Archive
account. This approach allows you to implement controls at depth
to protect the integrity and availability of the logs and log
management process, distinct from the tools that access them.
Consider using services, such as
[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), to run on-demand queries that correlate multiple
data sources. You can also integrate visualization tools, such as
[Quick](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/). AI-powered solutions are becoming increasingly
available and can perform functions such as translating findings
into human-readable summaries and natural language interaction. These solutions are often more readily integrated by having a
standardized data storage location for querying.

## Implementation steps

- **Create the Log Archive and Security
Tooling accounts**

Using AWS Organizations,
[create
the Log Archive and Security Tooling accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) under
a security organizational unit. If you are using AWS Control Tower to manage your organization, the Log Archive
and Security Tooling accounts are created for you
automatically. Configure roles and permissions for
accessing and administering these accounts as required.

- **Configure your standardized security
data locations**

Determine your strategy for creating standardized security
data locations.  You can achieve this through options like
common data lake architecture approaches, third-party data
products, or
[Amazon Security Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).  AWS recommends that you capture
security data from AWS Regions that are
[opted-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html)
for your accounts, even when not actively in use.

- **Configure data source publication to
your standardized locations**

Identify the sources for your security data and configure
them to publish into your standardized locations. Evaluate
options to automatically export data in the desired format
as opposed to those where ETL processes need to be
developed. With Amazon Security Lake, you
can [collect
data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/source-management.html) from supported AWS sources and integrated
third-party systems.

- **Configure tools to access your
standardized locations**

Configure tools such as Amazon Athena, Quick,
or third-party solutions to have the access required to
your standardized locations.  Configure these tools to
operate out of the Security Tooling account with
cross-account read access to the Log Archive account where
applicable.
[Create
subscribers in Amazon Security Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/subscriber-management.html) to provide
these tools access to your data.

# SEC04-BP03 Correlate and enrich security alerts

Unexpected activity can generate multiple security alerts by
different sources, requiring further correlation and enrichment to
understand the full context. Implement automated correlation and
enrichment of security alerts to help achieve more accurate incident
identification and response.

**Desired outcome:** As activity
generates different alerts within your workloads and environments,
automated mechanisms correlate data and enrich that data with
additional information. This pre-processing presents a more detailed
understanding of the event, which helps your investigators determine
the criticality of the event and if it constitutes an incident that
requires formal response. This process reduces the load on your
monitoring and investigation teams.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Different groups of people investigate findings and alerts
generated by different systems, unless otherwise mandated by
separation of duty requirements.
- Your organization funnels all security finding and alert data to
standard locations, but requires investigators to perform manual
correlation and enrichment.
- You rely solely on the intelligence of threat detection systems
to report on findings and establish criticality.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automated correlation and enrichment of alerts
helps to reduce the overall cognitive load and manual data
preparation required of your investigators. This practice can reduce
the time it takes to determine if the event represents an incident
and initiate a formal response. Additional context also helps you
accurately assess the true severity of an event, as it may be higher
or lower than what any one alert suggests.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Security alerts can come from many different sources within AWS,
including:

- Services such as
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/),
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/),
[Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/),
[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/),
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/),
[AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html), and
[Network Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/network-access-analyzer/what-is-vaa.html)
- Alerts from automated analysis of AWS service, infrastructure,
and application logs, such as from
[Security
Analytics for Amazon OpenSearch Service.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/security-analytics.html)
- Alarms in response to changes in your billing activity from
sources such as
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch),
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), or
[AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/).
- Third-party sources such as threat intelligence feeds
and [Security
Partner Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/) from the AWS Partner Network
- [Contact
by AWS Trust & Safety](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/aws-abuse-report) or other sources, such as
customers or internal employees.
- Use [Threat Technique Catalog by AWS (TTC)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-cirt-announces-the-launch-of-the-threat-technique-catalog-for-aws/) to assist with identification and correlation of threat actor behavior through indicator of compromise (IoC) identification. The TTC is an extension of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, categorizing all known and observed threat actor behaviors and techniques directed at AWS resources.

In their most fundamental form, alerts contain information about
who (the *principal* or
*identity*) is doing what
*(*the *action* taken) to
what (the *resources* affected). For each of
these sources, identify if there are ways you can create mappings
across identifiers for these identities, actions, and resources as
the foundation for performing correlation. This can take the form
of integrating alert sources with a security information and event
management (SIEM) tool to perform automated correlation for you,
building your own data pipelines and processing, or a combination
of both.

An example of a service that can perform correlation for you is
[Amazon Detective](https://aws.amazon.com/detective). Detective performs ongoing ingestion of alerts
from various AWS and third-party sources and uses different forms
of intelligence to assemble a visual graph of their relationships
to aid investigations.

While the initial criticality of an alert is an aid for
prioritization, the context in which the alert happened determines
its true criticality. As an example,
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) can alert that an Amazon EC2 instance within your
workload is querying an unexpected domain name. GuardDuty might
assign low criticality to this alert on its own. However,
automated correlation with other activity around the time of the
alert might uncover that several hundred EC2 instances were
deployed by the same identity, which increases overall operating
costs. In this event, this correlated event context would warrant
a new security alert and the criticality might be adjusted to
high, which would expedite further action.

### Implementation steps

- Identify sources for security alert information. Understand
how alerts from these systems represent identity, action,
and resources to determine where correlation is possible.
- Establish a mechanism for capturing alerts from different
sources. Consider services such as Security Hub CSPM,
EventBridge, and CloudWatch for this purpose.
- Identify sources for data correlation and enrichment.
Example sources include
[AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/),
[VPC
Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html),
[Route 53
Resolver logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logs.html), and infrastructure and application
logs. Any or all of these logs might be consumed through a
single integration with
[Amazon
Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/).
- Integrate your alerts with your data correlation and
enrichment sources to create more detailed security event
contexts and establish criticality.

Amazon Detective, SIEM tooling, or other third-party
solutions can perform a certain level of ingestion,
correlation, and enrichment automatically.
- You can also use AWS services to build your own. For
example, you can invoke an AWS Lambda function to run an
Amazon Athena query against AWS CloudTrail or
Amazon Security Lake, and publish the results to EventBridge.

# SEC04-BP04 Initiate remediation for non-compliant resources

Your detective controls may alert on resources that are out of
compliance with your configuration requirements. You can initiate
programmatically-defined remediations, either manually or
automatically, to fix these resources and help minimize potential
impacts. When you define remediations programmatically, you can take
prompt and consistent action.

While automation can enhance security operations, you should
implement and manage automation carefully.  Place appropriate
oversight and control mechanisms to verify that automated responses
are effective, accurate, and aligned with organizational policies
and risk appetite.

**Desired outcome:** You define
resource configuration standards along with the steps to remediate
when resources are detected to be non-compliant. Where possible,
you've defined remediations programmatically so they can be
initiated either manually or through automation. Detection systems
are in place to identify non-compliant resources and publish alerts
into centralized tools that are monitored by your security
personnel. These tools support running your programmatic
remediations, either manually or automatically. Automatic
remediations have appropriate oversight and control mechanisms in
place to govern their use.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You implement automation, but fail to thoroughly test and
validate remediation actions. This can result in unintended
consequences, such as disrupting legitimate business operations
or causing system instability.
- You improve response times and procedures through automation,
but without proper monitoring and mechanisms that allow human
intervention and judgment when needed.
- You rely solely on remediations, rather than having remediations
as one part of a broader incident response and recovery program.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automatic remediations can respond to
misconfigurations faster than manual processes, which helps you
minimize potential business impacts and reduce the window of
opportunity for unintended uses. When you define remediations
programmatically, they are applied consistently, which reduces the
risk of human error. Automation also can handle a larger volume of
alerts simultaneously, which is particularly important in
environments operating at large scale.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

As described in [SEC01-BP03 Identify and validate control objectives](./sec_securely_operate_control_objectives.html), services such as
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) can help you monitor the configuration of
resources in your accounts for adherence to your requirements.
When non-compliant resources are detected, services such as AWS Security Hub CSPM, can help with routing alerts appropriately and
remediation. These solutions provide a central place for your
security investigators to monitor for issues and take corrective
action.

In addition to AWS Security Hub CSPM, AWS introduced [Security Hub Advanced](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/). This service, announced at re:Invent 2025, transforms how organizations prioritize their most critical security issues and respond at scale to protect their cloud environments. The enhanced Security Hub now uses advanced analytics to automatically correlate, enrich, and prioritize security signals across your cloud environment. Security Hub seamlessly integrates with [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/), [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/), [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/), and [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/cspm/features/). Correlated findings in Security Hub can result in a net-new finding, called an exposure finding, which includes an assumed attack path based on vulnerabilities found in each resource.

While some non-compliant resource situations are unique and
require human judgment to remediate, other situations have a
standard response that you can define programmatically. For
example, a standard response to a misconfigured VPC security group
could be to remove the disallowed rules and notify the owner.
Responses can be defined in
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda) functions,
[AWS Systems Manager Automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) documents, or through other code
environments you prefer. Make sure the environment is able to
authenticate to AWS using an IAM role with the least amount of
permission needed to take corrective action.

Once you define the desired remediation, you can then determine
your preferred means for initiating it. AWS Config can
[initiate
remediations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/remediation.html) for you. If you are using Security Hub CSPM, you
can do this through
[custom
actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cwe-custom-actions.html), which publishes the finding information to
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). An EventBridge rule can then initiate your
remediation. You can configure remediations through Security Hub CSPM
to run either automatically or manually.

For programmatic remediation, we recommend that you have
comprehensive logs and audits for the actions taken, as well as
their outcomes. Review and analyze these logs to assess the
effectiveness of the automated processes, and identify areas of
improvement. Capture logs in
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) and remediation outcomes as
[finding
notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-findings.html) in Security Hub CSPM.

As a starting point, consider
[Automated
Security Response on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/automated-security-response-on-aws/), which has pre-built remediations
for resolving common security misconfigurations.

### Implementation steps

- Analyze and prioritize alerts.

Consolidate security alerts from various AWS services
into Security Hub CSPM for centralized visibility,
prioritization, and remediation.

- Develop remediations.

Use services such as Systems Manager and AWS Lambda to
run programmatic remediations.

- Configure how remediations are initiated.

Using Systems Manager, define custom actions that
publish findings to EventBridge. Configure these actions
to be initiated manually or automatically.
- You can also use
[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to send
notifications and alerts to relevant stakeholders (like
security team or incident response teams) for manual
intervention or escalation, if required.

- Review and analyze remediation logs for effectiveness and
improvement.

Send log output to CloudWatch Logs. Capture outcomes as
finding notes in Security Hub CSPM.

## Question SEC05

# SEC 5 — How do you protect your network resources?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# SEC05-BP01 Create network layers

Segment your network topology into different layers based on logical
groupings of your workload components according to their data
sensitivity and access requirements. Distinguish between components
that require inbound access from the internet, such as public web
endpoints, and those that only need internal access, such as
databases.

**Desired outcome:** The layers of
your network are part of an integral defense-in-depth approach to
security that complements the identity authentication and
authorization strategy of your workloads. Layers are in place
according to data sensitivity and access requirements, with
appropriate traffic flow and control mechanisms.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You create all resources in a single VPC or subnet.
- You construct your network layers without consideration of data
sensitivity requirements, component behaviors, or functionality.
- You use VPCs and subnets as defaults for all network layer
considerations, and you don't consider how AWS managed services
influence your topology.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Establishing network layers is the first step
in restricting unnecessary pathways through the network,
particularly those that lead to critical systems and data. This
makes it harder for unauthorized actors to gain access to your
network and navigate to additional resources within. Discrete
network layers beneficially reduce the scope of analysis for
inspection systems, such as for intrusion detection or malware
prevention. This reduces the potential for false positives and
unnecessary processing overhead.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice

## Implementation guidance

When designing a workload architecture, it is common to separate
components into different layers based on their responsibility.
For example, a web application can have a presentation layer,
application layer, and data layer. You can
take a similar approach when designing your network topology.
Underlying network controls can help enforce your workload's data
access requirements. For example, in a three-tier web application
architecture, you can store your static presentation layer files
on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and serve them from a content delivery network (CDN),
such as [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). The application layer can have public
endpoints that an [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/) serves in an
[Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) public subnet (similar to a demilitarized zone, or
DMZ), with back-end services deployed into private subnets. The
data layer, that is hosting resources such as databases and shared
file systems, can reside in different private subnets from the
resources of your application layer. At each of these layer
boundaries (CDN, public subnet, private subnet), you can deploy
controls that allow only authorized traffic to traverse across
those boundaries.

Similar to modeling network layers based on the functional purpose
of your workload's components, also consider the sensitivity of
the data being processed. Using the web application example,
while all of your workload services may reside within the
application layer, different services may process data with
different sensitivity levels. In this case, dividing the
application layer using multiple private subnets, different VPCs
in the same AWS account, or even different VPCs in different AWS accounts for each level of data sensitivity may be appropriate
according to your control requirements.

A further consideration for network layers is the behavior
consistency of your workload's components. Continuing the
example, in the application layer you may have services that
accept inputs from end-users or external system integrations that
are inherently riskier than the inputs to other services. Examples
include file uploads, code scripts to run, email scanning and so
on. Placing these services in their own network layer helps
create a stronger isolation boundary around them, and can prevent
their unique behavior from creating false positive alerts in
inspection systems.

As part of your design, consider how using AWS managed services
influences your network topology. Explore how services such as
[Amazon VPC Lattice](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/lattice/) can help make the interoperability of your
workload components across network layers easier. When using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), deploy in your VPC subnets unless there are specific
reasons not to. Determine where VPC endpoints and [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/)
can simplify adhering to security policies that limit access to
internet gateways.

### Implementation steps

- Review your workload architecture. Logically group
components and services based on the functions they serve,
the sensitivity of data being processed, and their behavior.
- For components responding to requests from the internet,
consider using load balancers or other proxies to provide
public endpoints. Explore shifting security controls by
using managed services, such as CloudFront, [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), Elastic Load Balancing, and [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to host
public endpoints.
- For components running in compute environments, such as
Amazon EC2 instances, [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) containers, or Lambda
functions, deploy these into private subnets based on your
groups from the first step.
- For fully managed AWS services, such as [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/),
[Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), or [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), consider using VPC
endpoints as the default for access over private IP
addresses.

# SEC05-BP02 Control traffic flow within your network layers

Within the layers of your network, use further segmentation to
restrict traffic only to the flows necessary for each workload.
First, focus on controlling traffic between the internet or other
external systems to a workload and your environment
(*north-south* traffic). Afterwards, look at
flows between different components and systems
(*east-west* traffic).

**Desired outcome:** You permit only
the network flows necessary for the components of your workloads to
communicate with each other and their clients and any other services
they depend on. Your design factors in considerations such as public
compared to private ingress and egress, data classification,
regional regulations, and protocol requirements. Wherever possible,
you favor point-to-point flows over network peering as part of a
*principle of least privilege* design.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You take a perimeter-based approach to network security and only
control traffic flow at the boundary of your network layers.
- You assume all traffic within a network layer is authenticated
and authorized.
- You apply controls for either your ingress traffic or your
egress traffic, but not both.
- You rely solely on your workload components and network controls
to authenticate and authorize traffic.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** This practice helps reduce the risk of
unauthorized movement within your network and adds an extra layer of
authorization to your workloads. By performing traffic flow control,
you can restrict the scope of impact of a security incident and
speed up detection and response.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

While network layers help establish the boundaries around
components of your workload that serve a similar function, data
sensitivity level, and behavior, you can create a much
finer-grained level of traffic control by using techniques to
further segment components within these layers that follows the
principle of least privilege. Within AWS, network layers are
primarily defined using subnets according to IP address ranges
within an Amazon VPC. Layers can also be defined using different
VPCs, such as for grouping microservice environments by business
domain. When using multiple VPCs, mediate routing using an [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/). While this provides traffic control at a Layer 4
level (IP address and port ranges) using security groups and route
tables, you can gain further control using additional services,
such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/), [Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-dns-firewall.html),
[AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/), and [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/).

Understand and inventory the data flow and communication
requirements of your workloads in terms of connection-initiating
parties, ports, protocols, and network layers. Evaluate the
protocols available for establishing connections and transmitting
data to select ones that achieve your protection requirements (for
example, HTTPS rather than HTTP). Capture these requirements at
both the boundaries of your networks and within each layer. Once
these requirements are identified, explore options to only allow
the required traffic to flow at each connection point. A good
starting point is to use *security
groups* within your VPC, as they can be attached to
resources that uses an Elastic Network Interface (ENI), such
Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EKS pods, or Amazon RDS databases. Unlike a Layer 4 firewall, a security group can
have a rule that allows traffic from another security group by its
identifier, minimizing updates as resources within the group
change over time. You can also filter traffic using both inbound
and outbound rules using security groups.

When traffic moves between VPCs, it's common to use VPC peering
for simple routing or the AWS Transit Gateway for complex routing.
With these approaches, you facilitate traffic flows between the
range of IP addresses of both the source and destination networks.
However, if your workload only requires traffic flows between
specific components in different VPCs, consider using a
point-to-point connection using
[AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/). To do this, identify which service should act
as the producer and which should act as the consumer. Deploy a
compatible load balancer for the producer, turn on PrivateLink
accordingly, and then accept a connection request by the
consumer. The producer service is then assigned a private IP
address from the consumer's VPC that the consumer can use to make
subsequent requests. This approach reduces the need to peer the
networks. Include the costs for data processing and load balancing
as part of evaluating PrivateLink.

While security groups and PrivateLink help control the flow
between the components of your workloads, another major
consideration is how to control which DNS domains your resources
are allowed to access (if any). Depending on the DHCP
configuration of your VPCs, you can consider two different AWS
services for this purpose. Most customers use the default Route 53
Resolver DNS service (also called Amazon DNS server or
AmazonProvidedDNS) available to VPCs at the +2 address of its CIDR
range. With this approach, you can create DNS Firewall rules and
associate them to your VPC that determine what actions to take for
the domain lists you supply.

If you are not using the Route 53 Resolver, or if you want to
complement the Resolver with deeper inspection and flow control
capabilities beyond domain filtering, consider deploying an AWS Network Firewall. This service inspects individual packets using
either stateless or stateful rules to determine whether to deny or
allow the traffic. You can take a similar approach for filtering
inbound web traffic to your public endpoints using AWS WAF. For
further guidance on these services, see [SEC05-BP03 Implement
inspection-based protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_inspection.html).

### Implementation steps

- Identify the required data flows between the components of
your workloads.
- Apply multiple controls with a defense-in-depth approach for
both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of
security groups, and route tables.
- Use firewalls to define fine-grained control over network
traffic in, out, and across your VPCs, such as the Route 53
Resolver DNS Firewall, AWS Network Firewall, and AWS WAF.
Consider using the
[AWS Firewall Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/) for centrally configuring and
managing your firewall rules across your organization.

# SEC05-BP03 Implement inspection-based protection

Set up traffic inspection points between your network layers to make
sure data in transit matches the expected categories and patterns.
Analyze traffic flows, metadata, and patterns to help identify,
detect, and respond to events more effectively.

**Desired outcome:** Traffic that
traverses between your network layers are inspected and authorized.
Allow and deny decisions are based on explicit rules, threat
intelligence, and deviations from baseline behaviors.  Protections
become stricter as traffic moves closer to sensitive data.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Relying solely on firewall rules based on ports and protocols.
Not taking advantage of intelligent systems.
- Authoring firewall rules based on specific current threat
patterns that are subject to change.
- Only inspecting traffic where traffic transits from private to
public subnets, or from public subnets to the Internet.
- Not having a baseline view of your network traffic to compare
for behavior anomalies.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Inspection systems allow you to author
intelligent rules, such as allowing or denying traffic only when
certain conditions within the traffic data exist. Benefit from
managed rule sets from AWS and partners, based on the latest threat
intelligence, as the threat landscape changes over time.  This
reduces the overhead of maintaining rules and researching indicators
of compromise, reducing the potential for false positives.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Have fine-grained control over both your stateful and stateless
network traffic using AWS Network Firewall, or other
[Firewalls](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=firewalls)
and
[Intrusion
Prevention Systems](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=Intrusion+Prevention+Systems) (IPS) on AWS Marketplace that you can
deploy behind a [Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/gateway-load-balancer/).  AWS Network Firewall supports
[Suricata-compatible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/stateful-rule-groups-ips.html)
open source IPS specifications to help protect your workload.

Both the AWS Network Firewall and vendor solutions that use a GWLB
support different inline inspection deployment models.  For
example, you can perform inspection on a per-VPC basis, centralize
in an inspection VPC, or deploy in a hybrid model where east-west
traffic flows through an inspection VPC and Internet ingress is
inspected per-VPC.  Another consideration is whether the solution
supports unwrapping Transport Layer Security (TLS), enabling deep
packet inspection for traffic flows initiated in either direction.
For more information and in-depth details on these configurations,
see the
[AWS Network Firewall Best Practice guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-security-services-best-practices/guides/network-firewall/).

If you are using solutions that perform out-of-band inspections,
such as pcap analysis of packet data from network interfaces
operating in promiscuous mode, you can
configure [VPC
traffic mirroring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html). Mirrored traffic counts towards the
available bandwidth of your interfaces and is subject to the same
data transfer charges as non-mirrored traffic. You can see if
virtual versions of these appliances are available on the
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/infrastructure-software/cloud-networking), which may support inline deployment behind a
GWLB.

For components that transact over HTTP-based protocols, protect
your application from common threats with a web application
firewall (WAF). [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf) is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and
block HTTP(S) requests that match your configurable rules before
sending to Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront, AWS AppSync or
an Application Load Balancer. Consider deep packet inspection when
you evaluate the deployment of your web application firewall, as
some require you to terminate TLS before traffic inspection. To
get started with AWS WAF, you can use
[AWS Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html#getting-started-wizard-add-rule-group) in combination with your own, or use existing
[partner
integrations](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/partners/).

You can centrally manage AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, AWS Network Firewall, and Amazon VPC security groups across your AWS
Organization
with [AWS Firewall Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/).

## Implementation steps

- Determine if you can scope inspection rules broadly, such as
through an inspection VPC, or if you require a more granular
per-VPC approach.
- For inline inspection solutions:

If using AWS Network Firewall, create rules, firewall
policies, and the firewall itself. Once these have been
configured, you can
[route
traffic to the firewall endpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/) to enable
inspection.
- If using a third-party appliance with a Gateway Load
Balancer (GWLB), deploy and configure your appliance in
one or more availability zones. Then, create your GWLB,
the endpoint service, endpoint, and configure routing for
your traffic.

- For out-of-band inspection solutions:

Turn on VPC Traffic Mirroring on interfaces where inbound
and outbound traffic should be mirrored. You can use
Amazon EventBridge rules to invoke an AWS Lambda function
to turn on traffic mirroring on interfaces when new
resources are created. Point the traffic mirroring
sessions to the Network Load Balancer in front of your
appliance that processes traffic.

- For inbound web traffic solutions:

To configure AWS WAF, start by configuring a web access
control list (web ACL). The web ACL is a collection of
rules with a serially processed default action (ALLOW or
DENY) that defines how your WAF handles traffic. You can
create your own rules and groups or use AWS managed rule
groups in your web ACL.
- Once your web ACL is configured, associate the web ACL
with an AWS resource (like an Application Load Balancer,
API Gateway REST API, or CloudFront distribution) to begin
protecting web traffic.

# SEC05-BP04 Automate network protection

Automate the deployment of your network protections using DevOps
practices, such as *infrastructure as code* (IaC)
and CI/CD pipelines.  These practices can help you track changes in
your network protections through a version control system, reduce
the time it takes to deploy changes, and help detect if your network
protections drift from your desired configuration.

**Desired outcome:** You define
network protections with templates and commit them into a version
control system.  Automated pipelines are initiated when new changes
are made that orchestrates their testing and deployment.  Policy
checks and other static tests are in place to validate changes
before deployment.  You deploy changes into a staging environment to
validate the controls are operating as expected.  Deployment into
your production environments is also performed automatically once
controls are approved.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Relying on individual workload teams to each define their
complete network stack, protections, and automations.  Not
publishing standard aspects of the network stack and protections
centrally for workload teams to consume.
- Relying on a central network team to define all aspects of the
network, protections, and automations.  Not delegating
workload-specific aspects of the network stack and protections
to that workload's team.
- Striking the right balance between centralization and delegation
between a network team and workload teams, but not applying
consistent testing and deployment standards across your IaC
templates and CI/CD pipelines.  Not capturing required
configurations in tooling that checks your templates for
adherence.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Using templates to define your network
protections allows you to track and compare changes over time with a
version control system.  Using automation to test and deploy changes
creates standardization and predictability, increasing the chances
of a successful deployment and reducing repetitive manual
configurations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

A number of network protection controls described in
[SEC05-BP02 Control traffic flows
within your network layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_layered.html) and
[SEC05-BP03 Implement
inspection-based protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_inspection.html) come with managed rules systems
that can update automatically based on the latest threat
intelligence.  Examples of protecting your web endpoints include
[AWS WAF managed rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups.html) and
[AWS Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS
mitigation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-automatic-app-layer-response.html).
Use [AWS Network Firewall managed rule groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/nwfw-managed-rule-groups.html) to stay up to date
with low-reputation domain lists and threat signatures as well.

Beyond managed rules, we recommend you use DevOps practices to
automate deploying your network resources, protections, and the
rules you specify.  You can capture these definitions in
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) or another *infrastructure as
code* (IaC) tool of your choice, commit them to a
version control system, and deploy them using CI/CD pipelines.
Use this approach to gain the traditional benefits of DevOps for
managing your network controls, such as more predictable releases,
automated testing using tools like
[AWS CloudFormation Guard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/what-is-guard.html), and detecting drift between your
deployed environment and your desired configuration.

Based on the decisions you made as part of
[SEC05-BP01 Create network
layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html), you may have a central management approach to
creating VPCs that are dedicated for ingress, egress, and
inspection flows.  As described in the
[AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture), you can define
these VPCs in a dedicated
[Network
infrastructure account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/network.html).  You can use similar techniques to
centrally define the VPCs used by your workloads in other
accounts, their security groups, AWS Network Firewall deployments,
Route 53 Resolver rules and DNS Firewall configurations, and other
network resources.  You can share these resources with your other
accounts with the
[AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html).  With this approach, you can
simplify the automated testing and deployment of your network
controls to the Network account, with only one destination to
manage.  You can do this in a hybrid model, where you deploy and
share certain controls centrally and delegate other controls to
the individual workload teams and their respective accounts.

## Implementation steps

- Establish ownership over which aspects of the network and
protections are defined centrally, and which your workload
teams can maintain.
- Create environments to test and deploy changes to your network
and its protections.  For example, use a Network Testing
account and a Network Production account.
- Determine how you will store and maintain your templates in a
version control system.  Store central templates in a
repository that is distinct from workload repositories, while
workload templates can be stored in repositories specific to
that workload.
- Create CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy templates.  Define
tests to check for misconfigurations and that templates adhere
to your company standards.

## Question SEC06

# SEC 6 — How do you protect your compute resources?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 5

---

# SEC06-BP01 Perform vulnerability management

Frequently scan and patch for vulnerabilities in your code, dependencies, and in your infrastructure to help protect against new threats.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
solution that continually scans your workload for software
vulnerabilities, potential defects, and unintended network exposure.
You have established processes and procedures to identify,
prioritize, and remediate these vulnerabilities based on risk
assessment criteria. Additionally, you have implemented automated
patch management for your compute instances. Your vulnerability
management program is integrated into your software development
lifecycle, with solutions to scan your source code during the CI/CD
pipeline.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not having a vulnerability management program.
- Performing system patching without considering severity or risk avoidance.
- Using software that has passed its vendor-provided end of life (EOL) date.
- Deploying code into production before analyzing it for security issues.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Vulnerability management is a key aspect of maintaining a secure
and robust cloud environment. It involves a comprehensive process
that includes security scans, identification and prioritization of
issues, and patch operations to resolve the identified
vulnerabilities. Automation plays a pivotal role in this process
because it facilitates continuous scanning of workloads for
potential issues and unintended network exposure, as well as
remediation efforts.

The
[AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/shared-responsibility.html) is a fundamental concept that
underpins vulnerability management. According to this model, AWS
is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure,
including hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run
AWS services. Conversely, you are responsible for securing your
data, security configurations, and management tasks associated
with services like Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 objects.

AWS offers a range of services to support vulnerability management
programs.
[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) continuously scans AWS workloads for software
vulnerabilities and unintended network access, while
[AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html) helps manage patching across
Amazon EC2 instances. These services can be integrated with
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), a cloud security posture management service
that automates AWS security checks, centralizes security alerts,
and provides a comprehensive view of an organization's security
posture. Furthermore,
[Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) uses static code analysis to identify
potential issues in Java and Python applications during the
development phase.

By incorporating vulnerability management practices into the
software development lifecycle, you can proactively address
vulnerabilities before they are introduced into production
environments, which reduces the risk of security events and
minimizes the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

### Implementation steps

- **Understand the shared responsibility
model:** Review the AWS shared responsibility model
to understand your responsibilities for securing your
workloads and data in the cloud. AWS is responsible for
securing the underlying cloud infrastructure, while you are
responsible for securing your applications, data, and the
services you use.
- **Implement vulnerability
scanning**: Configure a vulnerability scanning
service, such as Amazon Inspector, to automatically scan
your compute instances (for example, virtual machines,
containers, or serverless functions) for software
vulnerabilities, potential defects, and unintended network
exposure.
- **Establish vulnerability management
processes:** Define processes and procedures to
identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities. This
may include the setup of regular vulnerability scanning
schedules, establishment of risk assessment criteria, and
definition of remediation timelines based on vulnerability
severity.
- **Set up patch management:**
Use a patch management service to automate the process of
patching your compute instances, both for operating systems
and applications. You can configure the service to scan
instances for missing patches and automatically install them
on a schedule. Consider AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to
provide this functionality.
- **Configure malware
protection:** Implement mechanisms to detect
malicious software in your environment. For example, you can
use tools like
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) to analyze, detect, and alert of malware in
EC2 and EBS volumes. GuardDuty can also scan newly uploaded
objects to Amazon S3 for potential malware or viruses and
take action to isolate them before they are ingested into
downstream processes.
- **Integrate vulnerability scanning in
CI/CD pipelines:** If you're using a CI/CD pipeline
for your application deployment, integrate vulnerability
scanning tools into your pipeline. Tools like Amazon CodeGuru Security and open-source options can scan your
source code, dependencies, and artifacts for potential
security issues.
- **Configure a security monitoring
service:** Set up a security monitoring service,
such as AWS Security Hub CSPM, to get a comprehensive view of
your security posture across multiple cloud services. The
service should collect security findings from various
sources and present them in a standardized format for easier
prioritization and remediation.
- **Implement web application
penetration testing**: If your application is a web
application, and your organization has the necessary skills
or can hire outside assistance, consider implementing web
application penetration testing to identify potential
vulnerabilities in your application.
- **Automate with infrastructure as
code**: Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools,
such as
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), to automate the deployment and
configuration of your resources, including the security
services mentioned previously. This practice helps you
create a more consistent and standardized resource
architecture across multiple accounts and environments.
- **Monitor and continually
improve**: Continually monitor your vulnerability
management program's effectiveness, and make improvements as
needed. Review security findings, assess the effectiveness
of your remediation efforts, and adjust your processes and
tools accordingly.

# SEC06-BP02 Provision compute from hardened images

Provide fewer opportunities for unintended access to your runtime
environments by deploying them from hardened images. Only acquire
runtime dependencies, such as container images and application
libraries, from trusted registries and verify their signatures.
Create your own private registries to store trusted images and
libraries for use in your build and deploy processes.

**Desired outcome:** Your compute
resources are provisioned from hardened baseline images. You
retrieve external dependencies, such as container images and
application libraries, only from trusted registries and verify their
signatures. These are stored in private registries for your build
and deployment processes to reference. You scan and update images
and dependencies regularly to help protect against any newly
discovered vulnerabilities.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Acquiring images and libraries from trusted registries, but not
verifying their signature or performing vulnerability scans
before putting into use.
- Hardening images, but not regularly testing them for new
vulnerabilities or updating to the latest version.
- Installing or not removing software packages that are not
required during the expected lifecycle of the image.
- Relying solely on patching to keep production compute resources
up to date. Patching alone can still cause compute resources to
drift from the hardened standard over time. Patching can also
fail to remove malware that may have been installed by a threat
actor during a security event.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Hardening images helps reduce the number of
paths available in your runtime environment that can allow
unintended access to unauthorized users or services. It also can
reduce the scope of impact should any unintended access occur.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To harden your systems, start from the latest versions of
operating systems, container images, and application libraries.
Apply patches to known issues. Minimize the system by removing any
unneeded applications, services, device drivers, default users,
and other credentials. Take any other needed actions, such as
disabling ports to create an environment that has only the
resources and capabilities needed by your workloads. From this
baseline, you can then install software, agents, or other
processes you need for purposes such as workload monitoring or
vulnerability management.

You can reduce the burden of hardening systems by using guidance
that trusted sources provide, such as the
[Center for Internet
Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) (CIS) and the Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) [Security
Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/). We recommend you
start with an
[Amazon
Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) (AMI) published by AWS or an APN partner, and
use the AWS [EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) to automate configuration according to an
appropriate combination of CIS and STIG controls.

While there are available hardened images and EC2 Image Builder
recipes that apply the CIS or DISA STIG recommendations, you may
find their configuration prevents your software from running
successfully. In this situation, you can start from a non-hardened
base image, install your software, and then incrementally apply
CIS controls to test their impact. For any CIS control that
prevents your software from running, test if you can implement the
finer-grained hardening recommendations in a DISA instead. Keep
track of the different CIS controls and DISA STIG configurations
you are able to apply successfully. Use these to define your image
hardening recipes in EC2 Image Builder accordingly.

For containerized workloads, hardened images from Docker are
available on the
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
[public
repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/docker). You can use EC2 Image Builder to harden
container images alongside AMIs.

Similar to operating systems and container images, you can obtain
code packages (or *libraries*) from public
repositories, through tooling such as pip, npm, Maven, and NuGet.
We recommend you manage code packages by integrating private
repositories, such as within
[AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/), with trusted public repositories. This
integration can handle retrieving, storing, and keeping packages
up-to-date for you. Your application build processes can then
obtain and test the latest version of these packages alongside
your application, using techniques like Software Composition
Analysis (SCA), Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

For serverless workloads that use AWS Lambda, simplify managing
package dependencies using
[Lambda
layers.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html) Use Lambda layers to configure a set of standard
dependencies that are shared across different functions into a
standalone archive. You can create and maintain layers through
their own build process, providing a central way for your
functions to stay up-to-date.

## Implementation steps

- Harden operating systems. Use base images from trusted sources
as a foundation for building your hardened AMIs. Use
[EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) to help customize the software installed
on your images.
- Harden containerized resources. Configure containerized
resources to meet security best practices. When using
containers, implement
[ECR
Image Scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html) in your build pipeline and on a regular
basis against your image repository to look for CVEs in your
containers.
- When using serverless implementation with AWS Lambda, use
[Lambda
layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html) to segregate application function code and
shared dependent libraries. Configure
[code
signing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html) for Lambda to make sure that only trusted code
runs in your Lambda functions.

# SEC06-BP03 Reduce manual management and interactive access

Use automation to perform deployment, configuration, maintenance,
and investigative tasks wherever possible. Consider manual access to
compute resources in cases of emergency procedures or in safe
(sandbox) environments, when automation is not available.

**Desired outcome:** Programmatic
scripts and automation documents (runbooks) capture authorized
actions on your compute resources. These runbooks are initiated
either automatically, through change detection systems, or
manually, when human judgment is required. Direct access to compute
resources is only made available in emergency situations when
automation is not available. All manual activities are logged and
incorporated into a review process to continually improve your
automation capabilities.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Interactive access to Amazon EC2 instances with protocols such
as SSH or RDP.
- Maintaining individual user logins such as `/etc/passwd` or
Windows local users.
- Sharing a password or private key to access an instance among
multiple users.
- Manually installing software and creating or updating
configuration files.
- Manually updating or patching software.
- Logging into an instance to troubleshoot problems.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Performing actions with automation helps you to
reduce the operational risk of unintended changes and
misconfigurations. Removing the use of Secure Shell (SSH) and Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) for interactive access reduces the scope of
access to your compute resources. This takes away a common path for
unauthorized actions. Capturing your compute resource management
tasks in automation documents and programmatic scripts provides a
mechanism to define and audit the full scope of authorized
activities at a fine-grained level of detail.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Logging into an instance is a classic approach to system
administration. After installing the server operating system,
users would typically log in manually to configure the system and
install the desired software. During the server's lifetime, users
might log in to perform software updates, apply patches, change
configurations, and troubleshoot problems.

Manual access poses a number of risks, however. It requires a
server that listens for requests, such as an SSH or RDP service,
that can provide a potential path to unauthorized access. It also
increases the risk of human error associated with performing
manual steps. These can result in workload incidents, data
corruption or destruction, or other security issues. Human access
also requires protections against the sharing of credentials,
creating additional management overhead.

To mitigate these risks, you can implement an agent-based remote
access solution, such as
[AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/). AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) initiates an encrypted
channel and thus does not rely on listening for
externally-initiated requests. Consider configuring SSM Agent to
[establish
this channel over a VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-create-vpc.html).

Systems Manager gives you fine-grained control over how you can interact with
your managed instances. You define the automations to run, who can
run them, and when they can run. Systems Manager can apply patches, install
software, and make configuration changes without interactive
access to the instance. Systems Manager can also provide access to a remote
shell and log every command invoked, and its output, during the
session to logs and
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
[AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) records invocations of Systems Manager APIs for inspection.

### Implementation steps

- [Install
AWS Systems Manager Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/manually-install-ssm-agent-linux.html) (SSM Agent) on your Amazon EC2 instances. Check to see if SSM Agent is included and
started automatically as part of your base AMI
configuration.
- Verify that the IAM Roles associated with your EC2 instance
profiles include the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
[managed
IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.html).
- Disable SSH, RDP, and other remote access services running
on your instances. You can do this by running scripts
configured in the user data section of your launch
templates or by building customized AMIs with tools such as
EC2 Image Builder.
- Verify that the security group ingress rules applicable to
your EC2 instances do not permit access on port 22/tcp (SSH)
or port 3389/tcp (RDP). Implement detection and alerting on
misconfigured security groups using services such as AWS Config.
- Define appropriate automations, runbooks, and run commands
in Systems Manager. Use IAM policies to define who can perform these
actions and the conditions under which they are permitted.
Test these automations thoroughly in a non-production
environment. Invoke these automations when necessary,
instead of interactively accessing the instance.
- Use
[AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) to provide
interactive access to instances when necessary. Turn on
session activity logging to maintain an audit trail in
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

# SEC06-BP04 Validate software integrity

Use cryptographic verification to validate the integrity of software
artifacts (including images) your workload uses.  Cryptographically
sign your software as a safeguard against unauthorized changes run
within your compute environments.

**Desired outcome:** All artifacts
are obtained from trusted sources. Vendor website certificates are
validated.  Downloaded artifacts are cryptographically verified by
their signatures. Your own software is cryptographically signed and
verified by your computing environments.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Trusting reputable vendor websites to obtain software artifacts,
but ignoring certificate expiration notices.  Proceeding with
downloads without confirming certificates are valid.
- Validating vendor website certificates, but not
cryptographically verifying downloaded artifacts from these
websites.
- Relying solely on digests or hashes to validate software
integrity.  Hashes establish that artifacts have not been
modified from the original version, but do not validate their
source.
- Not signing your own software, code, or libraries, even when
only used in your own deployments.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Validating the integrity of artifacts that your
workload depends on helps prevent malware from entering your compute
environments.  Signing your software helps safeguard against
unauthorized running in your compute environments.   Secure your
software supply chain by signing and verifying code.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Operating system images, container images, and code artifacts are
often distributed with integrity checks available, such as through
a digest or hash.  These allow clients to verify integrity by
computing their own hash of the payload and validating it is the
same as the one published.  While these checks help verify that
the payload has not been tampered with, they do not validate the
payload came from the original source (its
*provenance*).  Verifying provenance requires a
certificate that a trusted authority issues to digitally sign the
artifact.

If you are using a downloaded software or artifacts in your
workload, check if the provider provides a public key for digital
signature verification.  Here are some examples of how AWS
provides a public key and verification instructions for software
we publish:

- [EC2 Image Builder: Verify the signature of the AWSTOE installation
download](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/awstoe-verify-sig.html)
- [AWS Systems Manager: Verifying the signature of SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/verify-agent-signature.html)
- [Amazon CloudWatch: Verifying the signature of the CloudWatch agent
package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/verify-CloudWatch-Agent-Package-Signature.html)

Incorporate digital signature verification into the processes you
use for obtaining and hardening images, as discussed in
[SEC06-BP02 Provision compute from
hardened images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_hardened_images.html).

You can use
[AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) to help manage the verification of signatures, as
well as your own code-signing lifecycle for your own software and
artifacts.  Both
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) provide integrations with Signer
to verify the signatures of your code and images.  Using the
examples in the Resources section, you can incorporate Signer into
your continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to
automate verification of signatures and the signing of your own
code and images.

# SEC06-BP05 Automate compute protection

Automate compute protection operations to reduce the need for human
intervention. Use automated scanning to detect potential issues
within your compute resources, and remediate with automated
programmatic responses or fleet management operations.  Incorporate
automation in your CI/CD processes to deploy trustworthy workloads
with up-to-date dependencies.

**Desired outcome:** Automated
systems perform all scanning and patching of compute resources. You
use automated verification to check that software images and
dependencies come from trusted sources, and have not been tampered
with. Workloads are automatically checked for up-to-date
dependencies, and are signed to establish trustworthiness in AWS
compute environments.  Automated remediations are initiated when
non-compliant resources are detected.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Following the practice of immutable infrastructure, but not
having a solution in place for emergency patching or replacement
of production systems.
- Using automation to fix misconfigured resources, but not having
a manual override mechanism in place.  Situations may arise
where you need to adjust the requirements, and you may need to
suspend automations until you make these changes.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automation can reduce the risk of unauthorized
access and use of your compute resources.  It helps to prevent
misconfigurations from making their way into production
environments, and detecting and fixing misconfigurations should they
occur.  Automation also helps to detect unauthorized access and use
of compute resources to reduce your time to respond.  This in turn
can reduce the overall scope of impact from the issue.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

You can apply the automations described in the Security Pillar
practices for protecting your compute resources.
[SEC06-BP01 Perform vulnerability
management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_vulnerability_management.html) describes how you can use
[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) in both your CI/CD pipelines and for continually
scanning your runtime environments for known Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).  You can use
[AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) to apply patches or redeploy from fresh
images through automated runbooks to keep your compute fleet
updated with the latest software and libraries.  Use these
techniques to reduce the need for manual processes and interactive
access to your compute resources.  See
[SEC06-BP03 Reduce manual
management and interactive access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_reduce_manual_management.html) to learn more.

Automation also plays a role in deploying workloads that are
trustworthy, described in
[SEC06-BP02 Provision compute from
hardened images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_hardened_images.html) and
[SEC06-BP04 Validate software
integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_validate_software_integrity.html).  You can use services such as
[EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/),
[AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html),
[AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/), and
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to download, verify, construct,
and store hardened and approved images and code dependencies.
Alongside Inspector, each of these can play a role in your CI/CD
process so your workload makes its way to production only when it
is confirmed that its dependencies are up-to-date and from trusted
sources.  Your workload is also signed so AWS compute
environments, such as
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) can verify it hasn't been tampered
with before allowing it to run.

Beyond these preventative controls, you can use automation in your
detective controls for your compute resources as well.  As one
example,
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) offers the
[NIST
800-53 Rev. 5](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/nist-standard.html) standard that includes checks such
as [[EC2.8]
EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2
(IMDSv2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/ec2-controls.html#ec2-8).  IMDSv2 uses the techniques of session
authentication, blocking requests that contain an
X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, and a network TTL
of 1 to stop traffic originating from external sources to retrieve
information about the EC2 instance. This check in Security Hub CSPM can
detect when EC2 instances use IMDSv1 and initiate automated
remediation. Learn more about automated detection and remediations
in [SEC04-BP04
Initiate remediation for non-compliant resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_noncompliant_resources.html).

### Implementation steps

- Automate creating secure, compliant and hardened AMIs with
[EC2 Image Builder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/integ-compliance-products.html).  You can produce images that incorporate
controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Benchmarks or Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)
standards from base AWS and APN partner images.
- Automate configuration management. Enforce and validate secure
configurations in your compute resources automatically by
using a configuration management service or tool.

Automated configuration management
using [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/)
- Automated security and compliance posture management
using [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/)

- Automate patching or replacing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager
automates the process of patching managed instances with both
security-related and other types of updates. You can use Patch
Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and
applications.

[AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html)

- Automate scanning of compute resources for common
vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), and embed security
scanning solutions within your build pipeline.

[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/)
- [ECR
Image Scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html)

- Consider Amazon GuardDuty for automatic malware and threat
detection to protect compute resources. GuardDuty can also
identify potential issues when an
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) function gets invoked in your AWS environment.

[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/)

- Consider AWS Partner solutions. AWS Partners offer
industry-leading products that are equivalent, identical to,
or integrate with existing controls in your on-premises
environments. These products complement the existing AWS
services to allow you to deploy a comprehensive security
architecture and a more seamless experience across your cloud
and on-premises environments.

## Question SEC07

# SEC 7 — How do you classify your data?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# SEC07-BP01 Understand your data classification scheme

Understand the classification of data your workload is processing,
its handling requirements, the associated business processes, where
the data is stored, and who the data owner is.  Your data
classification and handling scheme should consider the applicable
legal and compliance requirements of your workload and what data
controls are needed. Understanding the data is the first step in the
data classification journey.

**Desired outcome:** The types of
data present in your workload are well-understood and documented.
Appropriate controls are in place to protect sensitive data based
on its classification.  These controls govern considerations such as
who is allowed to access the data and for what purpose, where the
data is stored, the encryption policy for that data and how
encryption keys are managed, the lifecycle for the data and its
retention requirements, appropriate destruction processes, what
backup and recovery processes are in place, and the auditing of
access.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not having a formal data classification policy in place to
define data sensitivity levels and their handling requirements
- Not having a good understanding of the sensitivity levels of
data within your workload, and not capturing this information in
architecture and operations documentation
- Failing to apply the appropriate controls around your data based
on its sensitivity and requirements, as outlined in your data
classification and handling policy
- Failing to provide feedback about data classification and
handling requirements to owners of the policies.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** This practice removes ambiguity around the appropriate
handling of data within your workload.  Applying a formal policy
that defines the sensitivity levels of data in your organization and
their required protections can help you comply with legal
regulations and other cybersecurity attestations and certifications.
Workload owners can have confidence in knowing where sensitive data
is stored and what protection controls are in place.  Capturing
these in documentation helps new team members better understand them
and maintain controls early in their tenure. These practices can
also help reduce costs by right sizing the controls for each type of
data.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

When designing a workload, you may be considering ways to protect
sensitive data intuitively.  For example, in a multi-tenant
application, it is intuitive to think of each tenant's data as
sensitive and put protections in place so that one tenant can't
access the data of another tenant.  Likewise, you may intuitively
design access controls so only administrators can modify data
while other users have only read-level access or no access at all.

By having these data sensitivity levels defined and captured in
policy, along with their data protection requirements, you can
formally identify what data resides in your workload. You can then
determine if the right controls are in place, if the controls can
be audited, and what responses are appropriate if data is found to
be mishandled.

To help identify where sensitive data resides within your
workload, consider using a data catalog. A data catalog is a
database that maps data in your organization, its location,
sensitivity level, and the controls in place to protect that data.
Additionally, consider using
[resource
tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) where available.  For example, you can apply a tag
that has a *tag key* of
`Classification` and a *tag
value* of `PHI` for protected health
information (PHI), and another tag that has a *tag
key* of `Sensitivity` and a
*tag value* of `High`.
Services such as
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) can then be used to monitor these resources for
changes and alert if they are modified in a way that brings them
out of compliance with your protection requirements (such as
changing the encryption settings).  You can capture the standard
definition of your tag keys and acceptable values using
[tag
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html), a feature of AWS Organizations. It is not
recommended that the tag key or value contains private or
sensitive data.

### Implementation steps

- Understand your organization's data classification scheme and
protection requirements.
- Identify the types of sensitive data processed by your
workloads.
- Capture the data in a data catalog that provides a single
view of where data resides in the organization and the level
of sensitivity of that data.
- Consider using resource and data-level tagging, where
available, to tag data with its sensitivity level and other
operational metadata that can help with monitoring and
incident response.

AWS Organizations tag policies can be used to enforce
tagging standards.

# SEC07-BP02 Apply data protection controls based on data sensitivity

Apply data protection controls that provide an appropriate level of
control for each class of data defined in your classification
policy.  This practice can allow you to protect sensitive data from
unauthorized access and use, while preserving the availability and
use of data.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
classification policy that defines the different levels of
sensitivity for data in your organization.  For each of these
sensitivity levels, you have clear guidelines published for approved
storage and handling services and locations, and their required
configuration.  You implement the controls for each level according
to the level of protection required and their associated costs.  You
have monitoring and alerting in place to detect if data is present
in unauthorized locations, processed in unauthorized environments,
accessed by unauthorized actors, or the configuration of related
services becomes non-compliant.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Applying the same level of protection controls across all data.
This may lead to over-provisioning security controls for
low-sensitivity data, or insufficient protection of highly
sensitive data.
- Not involving relevant stakeholders from security, compliance,
and business teams when defining data protection controls.
- Overlooking the operational overhead and costs associated with
implementing and maintaining data protection controls.
- Not conducting periodic data protection control reviews to
maintain alignment with classification policies.
- Not having a complete inventory of where data resides at rest
and in transit.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By aligning your controls to the classification
level of your data, your organization can invest in higher levels of
control where needed. This can include increasing resources on
securing, monitoring, measuring, remediating, and reporting.  Where
fewer controls are appropriate, you can improve the accessibility
and completeness of data for your workforce, customers, or
constituents.  This approach gives your organization the most
flexibility with data usage, while still adhering to data protection
requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing data protection controls based on data sensitivity
levels involves several key steps. First, identify the different
data sensitivity levels within your workload architecture (such as
public, internal, confidential, and restricted) and evaluate where
you store and process this data. Next, define isolation boundaries
around data based on its sensitivity level. We recommend you
separate data into different AWS accounts, using
[service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCPs) to restrict services and actions
allowed for each data sensitivity level. This way, you can create
strong isolation boundaries and enforce the principle of least
privilege.

After you define the isolation boundaries, implement appropriate
protection controls based on the data sensitivity levels. Refer to
best practices for [Protecting
data at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/protecting-data-at-rest.html) and
[Protecting data in
transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/protecting-data-in-transit.html) to implement relevant controls like encryption,
access controls, and auditing. Consider techniques like
tokenization or anonymization to reduce the sensitivity level of
your data. Simplify applying consistent data policies across your
business with a centralized system for tokenization and
de-tokenization.

Continuously monitor and test the effectiveness of the implemented
controls. Regularly review and update the data classification
scheme, risk assessments, and protection controls as your
organization's data landscape and threats evolve. Align the
implemented data protection controls with relevant industry
regulations, standards, and legal requirements. Further, provide
security awareness and training to help employees understand the
data classification scheme and their responsibilities in handling
and protecting sensitive data.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the classification and sensitivity levels of data
within your workload.
- Define isolation boundaries for each level and determine an
enforcement strategy.
- Evaluate the controls you define that govern access,
encryption, auditing, retention, and others required by your
data classification policy.
- Evaluate options to reduce the sensitivity level of data where
appropriate, such as using tokenization or anonymization.
- Verify your controls using automated testing and monitoring of
your configured resources.

# SEC07-BP03 Automate identification and classification

Automating the identification and classification of data can help
you implement the correct controls. Using automation to augment
manual determination reduces the risk of human error and exposure.

**Desired outcome:** You are able to
verify whether the proper controls are in place based on your
classification and handling policy. Automated tools and services
help you to identify and classify the sensitivity level of your
data.  Automation also helps you continually monitor your
environments to detect and alert if data is being stored or handled
in unauthorized ways so corrective action can be taken quickly.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Relying solely on manual processes for data identification and
classification, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
This can lead to inefficient and inconsistent data
classification, especially as data volumes grow.
- Not having mechanisms to track and manage data assets across the
organization.
- Overlooking the need for continuous monitoring and
classification of data as it moves and evolves within the
organization.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automating data identification and
classification can lead to more consistent and accurate application
of data protection controls, reducing the risk of human error.
Automation can also provide visibility into sensitive data access
and movement, helping you detect unauthorized handling and take
corrective action.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

While human judgment is often used to classify data during the
initial design phases of a workload, consider having systems in
place that automate identification and classification on test data
as a preventive control. For example, developers can be provided a
tool or service to scan representative data to determine its
sensitivity.  Within AWS, you can upload data sets into
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and
scan them using
[Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/),
[Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/), or
[Amazon Comprehend Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/).  Likewise, consider scanning data as
part of unit and integration testing to detect where sensitive
data is not expected. Alerting on sensitive data at this stage can
highlight gaps in protections before deployment to production.
Other features such as sensitive data detection in
[AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/detect-PII.html),
[Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-data-protection-managed-data-identifiers.htm), and
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html) can also be used to detect PII and take
mitigating action. For any automated tool or service, understand
how it defines sensitive data, and augment it with other human or
automated solutions to close any gaps as needed.

As a detective control, use ongoing monitoring of your
environments to detect if sensitive data is being stored in
non-compliant ways.  This can help detect situations such as
sensitive data being emitted into log files or being copied to a
data analytics environment without proper de-identification or
redaction.  Data that is stored in Amazon S3 can be continually
monitored for sensitive data using Amazon Macie.

### Implementation steps

- Review the data classification scheme within your
organization described in
[SEC07-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html).

With an understanding of your organization's data
classification scheme, you can establish accurate
processes for automated identification and
classification that align with your company's policies.

- Perform an initial scan of your environments for automated
identification and classification.

An initial full scan of your data can help produce a
comprehensive understanding of where sensitive data
resides in your environments. When a full scan is not
initially required or is unable to be completed up-front
due to cost, evaluate if data sampling techniques are
suitable to achieve your outcomes. For example, Amazon Macie can be configured to perform a broad automated
sensitive data discovery operation across your S3
buckets.  This capability uses sampling techniques to
cost-efficiently perform a preliminary analysis of where
sensitive data resides.  A deeper analysis of S3 buckets
can then be performed using a sensitive data discovery
job. Other data stores can also be exported to S3 to be
scanned by Macie.
- Establish access control defined in
[SEC07-BP02](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_define_protection.html) for
your data storage resources identified within your scan.

- Configure ongoing scans of your environments.

The automated sensitive data discovery capability of
Macie can be used to perform ongoing scans of your
environments.  Known S3 buckets that are authorized to
store sensitive data can be excluded using an allow list
in Macie.

- Incorporate identification and classification into your
build and test processes.

Identify tools that developers can use to scan data for
sensitivity while workloads are in development.  Use
these tools as part of integration testing to alert when
sensitive data is unexpected and prevent further
deployment.

- Implement a system or runbook to take action when sensitive
data is found in unauthorized locations.

Restrict access to data using auto-remediation. For
example, you can move this data to an S3 bucket with
restricted access or tag the object if you use
attribute-based access control (ABAC). Additionally,
consider masking the data when it is detected.
- Alert your data protection and incident response teams
to investigate the root cause of the incident. Any
learnings they identify can help prevent future
incidents.

# SEC07-BP04 Define scalable data lifecycle management

Understand your data lifecycle requirements as they relate to your
different levels of data classification and handling.  This can
include how data is handled when it first enters your environment,
how data is transformed, and the rules for its destruction. Consider
factors such as retention periods, access, auditing, and tracking
provenance.

**Desired outcome:** You classify
data as close as possible to the point and time of ingestion. When
data classification requires masking, tokenization, or other
processes that reduce sensitivity level, you perform these actions
as close as possible to point and time of ingestion.

You delete data in accordance with your policy when it is no longer
appropriate to keep, based on its classification.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing a one-size-fits-all approach to data lifecycle
management, without considering varying sensitivity levels and
access requirements.
- Considering lifecycle management only from the perspective of
either data that is usable, or data that is backed up, but not
both.
- Assuming that data that has entered your workload is valid,
without establishing its value or provenance.
- Relying on data durability as a substitute for data backups and
protection.
- Retaining data beyond its usefulness and required retention
period.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** A well-defined and scalable data lifecycle
management strategy helps maintain regulatory compliance, improves
data security, optimizes storage costs, and enables efficient data
access and sharing while maintaining appropriate controls.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Data within a workload is often dynamic.  The form it takes when
entering your workload environment can be different from when it
is stored or used in business logic, reporting, analytics, or
machine learning.  In addition, the value of data can change over
time. Some data is temporal in nature and loses value as it gets
older.  Consider how these changes to your data impact evaluation
under your data classification scheme and associated controls.
Where possible, use an automated lifecycle mechanism, such as
[Amazon S3 lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) and the
[Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/data-lifecycle-manager/), to configure your data retention,
archiving, and expiration processes. For data stored in DynamoDB,
you can use the
[Time
To Live (TTL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html) feature to define a per-item expiration
timestamp.

Distinguish between data that is available for use, and data that
is stored as a backup.  Consider using
[AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) to automate the backup of data across AWS services.
[Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html) provide a way to copy an EBS volume and store
it using S3 features, including lifecycle, data protection, and
access to protection mechanisms. Two of these mechanisms are
[S3
Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) and
[AWS Backup Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html), which can provide you with additional
security and control over your backups. Manage clear separation of
duties and access for backups. Isolate backups at the account
level to maintain separation from the affected environment during
an event.

Another aspect of lifecycle management is recording the history of
data as it progresses through your workload, called *data
provenance tracking*. This can give confidence that you
know where the data came from, any transformations performed, what
owner or process made those changes, and when.  Having this
history helps with troubleshooting issues and investigations
during potential security events.  For example, you can log
metadata about transformations in an
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table.  Within a data lake, you can keep copies of
transformed data in different S3 buckets for each data pipeline
stage. Store schema and timestamp information in an
[AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html).  Regardless of your solution, consider
the requirements of your end users to determine the appropriate
tooling you need to report on your data provenance.  This will
help you determine how to best track your provenance.

### Implementation steps

- Analyze the workload's data types, sensitivity levels, and
access requirements to classify the data and define
appropriate lifecycle management strategies.
- Design and implement data retention policies and automated
destruction processes that align with legal, regulatory, and
organizational requirements.
- Establish processes and automation for continuous monitoring,
auditing, and adjustment of data lifecycle management
strategies, controls, and policies as workload requirements
and regulations evolve.

Detect resources that do not have automated lifecycle
management turned on with
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-lifecycle-policy-check.html)

## Question SEC08

# SEC 8 — How do you protect your data at rest?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# SEC08-BP01 Implement secure key management

Secure key management includes the storage, rotation, access
control, and monitoring of key material required to secure data at
rest for your workload.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
scalable, repeatable, and automated key management mechanism. The
mechanism enforces least privilege access to key material and
provides the correct balance between key availability,
confidentiality, and integrity. You monitor access to the keys, and
if rotation of key material is required, you rotate them using an
automated process. You do not allow key material to be accessed by
human operators.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Human access to unencrypted key material.
- Creating custom cryptographic algorithms.
- Overly broad permissions to access key material.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** By establishing a
secure key management mechanism for your workload, you can help provide protection for your
content against unauthorized access. Additionally, you may be subject to regulatory requirements
to encrypt your data. An effective key management solution can provide technical mechanisms
aligned to those regulations to protect key material.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Encryption of data at rest is a fundamental security control. To
implement this control, your workload needs a mechanism to
securely store and manage the key material used to encrypt your
data at rest.

AWS offers the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to provide
durable, secure, and redundant storage for AWS KMS keys.
[Many
AWS services integrate with AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#integration) to support encryption
of your data. AWS KMS uses FIPS 140-3 Level 3 validated hardware
security modules to protect your keys. There is no mechanism to
export AWS KMS keys in plain text.

When deploying workloads using a multi-account strategy, you
should keep AWS KMS keys in the same account as the workload that
uses them.
[This
distributed model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/application.html#app-kms) places the responsibility for managing
the AWS KMS keys with your team. In other use cases, your
organization may choose to store AWS KMS keys into a centralized
account. This centralized structure requires additional policies
to enable the cross-account access required for the workload
account to access keys stored in the centralized account, but may
be more applicable in use cases where a single key is shared
across multiple AWS accounts.

Regardless of where the key material is stored, you should tightly
control access to the key through the use of
[key
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) and IAM policies. Key policies are the primary way
to control access to an AWS KMS key. Additionally, AWS KMS key
grants can provide access to AWS services to encrypt and decrypt
data on your behalf. Review the
[guidance
for access control to your AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies-best-practices.html).

You should monitor the use of encryption keys to detect unusual
access patterns. Operations performed using AWS managed keys and
customer managed keys stored in AWS KMS can be logged in AWS CloudTrail and should be reviewed periodically. Pay special
attention to monitoring key destruction events. To mitigate
accidental or malicious destruction of key material, key
destruction events do not delete the key material immediately.
Attempts to delete keys in AWS KMS are subject to a
[waiting
period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#deleting-keys-how-it-works), which defaults to 30 days and a minimum of 7 days,
providing administrators time to review these actions and roll
back the request if necessary.

Most AWS services use AWS KMS in a way that is transparent to you
- your only requirement is to decide whether to use an AWS managed
or customer managed key. If your workload requires the direct use
of AWS KMS to encrypt or decrypt data, you should use
[envelope
encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping) to protect your data. The
[AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html) can provide your applications client-side
encryption primitives to implement envelope encryption and
integrate with AWS KMS.

### Implementation steps

- Determine the appropriate
[key
management options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) (AWS managed or customer managed)
for the key.

For ease of use, AWS offers AWS owned and AWS managed
keys for most services, which provide encryption-at-rest
capability without the need to manage key material or
key policies.
- When using customer managed keys, consider the default
key store to provide the best balance between agility,
security, data sovereignty, and availability. Other use
cases may require the use of custom key stores with
[AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/) or the
[external
key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html).

- Review the list of services that you are using for your
workload to understand how AWS KMS integrates with the
service. For example, EC2 instances can use encrypted EBS
volumes, verifying that Amazon EBS snapshots created from
those volumes are also encrypted using a customer managed
key and mitigating accidental disclosure of unencrypted
snapshot data.

[How
AWS services use AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/service-integration.html)
- For detailed information about the encryption options
that an AWS service offers, see the Encryption at Rest
topic in the user guide or the developer guide for the
service.

- Implement AWS KMS: AWS KMS makes it simple for you to create
and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a
wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

[Getting
started: AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html)
- Review the
[best
practices for access control to your AWS KMS
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies-best-practices.html).

- Consider AWS Encryption SDK: Use the AWS Encryption SDK with
AWS KMS integration when your application needs to encrypt
data client-side.

[AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html)

- Enable
[IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) to automatically review and notify if
there are overly broad AWS KMS key policies.

Consider using
[custom
policy checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_CheckNoPublicAccess.html) to verify that a resource policy
update does not grant public access to KMS Keys.

- Enable
[Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/kms-controls.html) to receive notifications if there are
misconfigured key policies, keys scheduled for deletion, or
keys without automated rotation enabled.
- Determine the logging level appropriate for your AWS KMS
keys. Since calls to AWS KMS, including read-only events,
are logged, the CloudTrail logs associated with AWS KMS can
become voluminous.

Some organizations prefer to segregate the AWS KMS
logging activity into a separate trail. For more detail,
see the
[Logging
AWS KMS API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html) section of the
AWS KMS developers guide.

# SEC08-BP02 Enforce encryption at rest

Encrypt private data at rest to maintain confidentiality and provide
an additional layer of protection against unintended data disclosure
or exfiltration. Encryption protects data so that it cannot be read
or accessed without first being decrypted. Inventory and control
unencrypted data to mitigate risks associated with data exposure.

**Desired outcome:** You have mechanisms that encrypt private data by default when at rest. These mechanisms help maintain the confidentiality of the data and provides an additional layer of protection against unintended data disclosure or exfiltration. You maintain an inventory of unencrypted data and understand the controls that are in place to protect it.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not using encrypt-by-default configurations.
- Providing overly permissive access to decryption keys.
- Not monitoring the use of encryption and decryption keys.
- Storing data unencrypted.
- Using the same encryption key for all data regardless of data usage, types, and classification.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Map encryption keys to data classifications within your workloads. This approach helps protect against overly permissive access when using either a single, or very small number of encryption keys for your data (see [SEC07-BP01 Understand your data classification scheme](./sec_data_classification_identify_data.html)).

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) integrates with many AWS
services to make it easier to encrypt your data at rest. For
example, in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), you can set
[default
encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/work-with-ebs-encr.html#encryption-by-default) on accounts so that new EBS volumes are
automatically encrypted. When using AWS KMS, consider how tightly
the data needs to be restricted. Default and service-controlled
AWS KMS keys are managed and used on your behalf by AWS. For
sensitive data that requires fine-grained access to the underlying
encryption key, consider customer managed keys (CMKs). You have
full control over CMKs, including rotation and access management
through the use of key policies.

Additionally, services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service
([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-encrypts-new-objects-by-default/)) now encrypt all new objects by default. This
implementation provides enhanced security with no impact on
performance.

Other services, such as
[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) (Amazon EC2) or
[Amazon Elastic File System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/encryption-best-practices/efs.html) (Amazon EFS), support settings for
default encryption. You can also use
[AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) to automatically check that you are using
encryption for
[Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html),
[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-storage-encrypted.html),
[Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-default-encryption-kms.html), and other services within your organization.

AWS also provides options for client-side encryption, allowing you to encrypt data prior to uploading it to the cloud. The AWS Encryption SDK provides a way to encrypt your data using [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping). You provide the wrapping key, and the AWS Encryption SDK generates a unique data key for each data object it encrypts. Consider AWS CloudHSM if you need a managed single-tenant hardware security module (HSM). AWS CloudHSM allows you to generate, import, and manage cryptographic keys on a FIPS 140-2 level 3 validated HSM. Some use cases for AWS CloudHSM include protecting private keys for issuing a certificate authority (CA), and turning on transparent data encryption (TDE) for Oracle databases. The AWS CloudHSM Client SDK provides software that allows you to encrypt data client side using keys stored inside AWS CloudHSM prior to uploading your data into AWS. The Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client also allows you to encrypt and sign items prior to upload into a DynamoDB table.

### Implementation steps

- **Configure**[default
encryption for new Amazon EBS
volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html)**:**
Specify that you want all newly created Amazon EBS volumes
to be created in encrypted form, with the option of using
the default key provided by AWS or a key that you create.
- **Configure encrypted Amazon Machine
Images (AMIs):** Copying an existing AMI with
encryption configured will automatically encrypt root
volumes and snapshots.
- **Configure**[Amazon RDS
encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html)**:**
Configure encryption for your Amazon RDS database clusters
and snapshots at rest by using the encryption option.
- **Create and configure AWS KMS keys
with policies that limit access to the appropriate
principals for each classification of data:** For
example, create one AWS KMS key for encrypting production
data and a different key for encrypting development or test
data. You can also provide key access to other AWS accounts.
Consider having different accounts for your development and
production environments. If your production environment
needs to decrypt artifacts in the development account, you
can edit the CMK policy used to encrypt the development
artifacts to give the production account the ability to
decrypt those artifacts. The production environment can then
ingest the decrypted data for use in production.
- **Configure encryption in additional
AWS services:** For other AWS services you use,
review the
[security
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/) for that service to determine the
service's encryption options.

# SEC08-BP03 Automate data at rest protection

Use automation to validate and enforce data at rest controls.  Use
automated scanning to detect misconfiguration of your data storage
solutions, and perform remediations through automated programmatic
response where possible.  Incorporate automation in your CI/CD
processes to detect data storage misconfigurations before they are
deployed to production.

**Desired outcome:** Automated
systems scan and monitor data storage locations for misconfiguration
of controls, unauthorized access, and unexpected use.  Detection of
misconfigured storage locations initiates automated remediations.
Automated processes create data backups and store immutable copies
outside of the original environment.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not considering options to enable encryption by default
settings, where supported.
- Not considering security events, in addition to operational
events, when formulating an automated backup and recovery
strategy.
- Not enforcing public access settings for storage services.
- Not monitoring and audit your controls for protecting data at
rest.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automation helps to prevent the risk of
misconfiguring your data storage locations. It helps to prevent
misconfigurations from entering your production environments. This
best practice also helps with detecting and fixing misconfigurations
if they occur.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Automation is a theme throughout the practices for protecting your
data at rest.
[SEC01-BP06 Automate
deployment of standard security controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_securely_operate_automate_security_controls.html) describes how you
can capture the configuration of your resources using
*infrastructure as code* (IaC) templates, such
as
with [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).  These templates are committed to a version
control system, and are used to deploy resources on AWS through a
CI/CD pipeline.  These techniques equally apply to automating the
configuration of your data storage solutions, such as encryption
settings on Amazon S3 buckets.

You can check the settings that you define in your IaC templates
for misconfiguration in your CI/CD pipelines using rules in [AWS CloudFormation Guard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/what-is-guard.html).  You
can monitor settings that are not yet available in CloudFormation
or other IaC tooling for misconfiguration with
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/).  Alerts that Config generates for misconfigurations
can be remediated automatically, as described in
[SEC04-BP04 Initiate
remediation for non-compliant resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_noncompliant_resources.html).

Using automation as part of your permissions management strategy
is also an integral component of automated data protections.
[SEC03-BP02
Grant least privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html) and
[SEC03-BP04
Reduce permissions continuously](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_continuous_reduction.html) describe configuring
least-privilege access policies that are continually monitored by the [AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/access-analyzer/) to generate findings when permission can be reduced.  Beyond
automation for monitoring permissions, you can configure
[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) to watch for anomalous data access behavior for
your
[EBS
volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-ec2.html) (by way of an EC2 instance),
[S3
buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3-protection.html), and supported
[Amazon Relational Database Service databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/rds-protection.html).

Automation also plays a role in detecting when sensitive data is
stored in unauthorized locations.
[SEC07-BP03 Automate
identification and classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_data_classification_auto_classification.html) describes how
[Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) can monitor your S3 buckets for unexpected sensitive
data and generate alerts that can initiate an automated response.

Follow the practices in
[REL09
Back up data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/back-up-data.html) to develop an automated data backup and
recovery strategy. Data backup and recovery is as important for
recovering from security events as it is for operational events.

### Implementation steps

- Capture data storage configuration in IaC templates.  Use
automated checks in your CI/CD pipelines to detect
misconfigurations.

You can use for [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) your IaC templates, and
[CloudFormation
Guard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/what-is-guard.html) for checking templates for misconfiguration.
- Use [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) to run rules in a proactive evaluation mode.
Use this setting to check the compliance of a resource as
a step in your CI/CD pipeline before creating it.

- Monitor resources for data storage misconfigurations.

Set [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) to monitor data storage resources for
changes in control configurations and generate alerts to
invoke remediation actions when it detects a
misconfiguration.
- See
[SEC04-BP04 Initiate
remediation for non-compliant resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_noncompliant_resources.html)
for more guidance on automated remediations.

- Monitor and reduce data access permissions continually through
automation.

[IAM Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/access-analyzer/) can run continually to generate
alerts when permissions can potentially be reduced.

- Monitor and alert on anomalous data access behaviors.

[GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/)
watches for both known threat signatures and deviations
from baseline access behaviors for data storage resources
such as EBS volumes, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.

- Monitor and alert on sensitive data being stored in unexpected
locations.

Use
[Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) to continually scan your S3 buckets for
sensitive data.

- Automate secure and encrypted backups of your data.

[AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html) is a managed service that creates encrypted
and secure backups of various data sources on AWS.
[Elastic
Disaster Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/) allows you to copy full server
workloads and maintain continuous data protection with a
recovery point objective (RPO) measured in seconds.  You
can configure both services to work together to automate
creating data backups and copying them to failover
locations.  This can help keep your data available when
impacted by either operational or security events.

# SEC08-BP04 Enforce access control

To help protect your data at rest, enforce access control using
mechanisms such as isolation and versioning. Apply least privilege
and conditional access controls. Prevent granting public access to
your data.

**Desired outcome:** You verify that
only authorized users can access data on a need-to-know basis. You
protect your data with regular backups and versioning to prevent
against intentional or inadvertent modification or deletion of data.
You isolate critical data from other data to protect its
confidentiality and data integrity.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Storing data with different sensitivity requirements or classification together.
- Using overly permissive permissions on decryption keys.
- Improperly classifying data.
- Not retaining detailed backups of important data.
- Providing persistent access to production data.
- Not auditing data access or regularly reviewing permissions.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Protecting data at rest is important to maintain data integrity,
confidentiality, and compliance with regulatory requirements. You
can implement multiple controls to help achieve this, including
access control, isolation, conditional access, and versioning.

You can enforce access control with the principle of least
privilege, which provides only the necessary permissions to users
and services to perform their tasks. This includes access to
encryption keys. Review your
[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) to verify that
the level of access you grant is appropriate and that relevant
conditions apply.

You can separate data based on different classification levels by
using distinct AWS accounts for each level, and manage these
accounts using
[AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html). This isolation can help prevent unauthorized
access and minimizes the risk of data exposure.

Regularly review the level of access granted in Amazon S3 bucket
policies. Avoid using publicly readable or writeable buckets
unless absolutely necessary. Consider using
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) to detect publicly available buckets and Amazon CloudFront to serve content from Amazon S3. Verify that buckets
that should not allow public access are properly configured to
prevent it.

Implement versioning and object locking mechanisms for critical
data stored in Amazon S3.
[Amazon S3 versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) preserves previous versions of objects to
recover data from accidental deletion or overwrites.
[Amazon S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) provides mandatory access control for
objects, which prevents them from being deleted or overwritten,
even by the root user, until the lock expires. Additionally,
[Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html) offers a similar feature for archives
stored in Amazon Glacier.

### Implementation steps

- **Enforce access control with the
principle of least privilege**:

Review the access permissions granted to users and
services, and verify that they have only the necessary
permissions to perform their tasks.
- Review access to encryption keys by checking the
[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html).

- **Separate data based on different
classification levels**:

Use distinct AWS accounts for each data classification
level.
- Manage these accounts using
[AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).

- **Review Amazon S3 bucket and object
permissions**:

Regularly review the level of access granted in Amazon S3 bucket policies.
- Avoid using publicly readable or writeable buckets
unless absolutely necessary.
- Consider using
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) to detect publicly available buckets.
- Use Amazon CloudFront to serve content from Amazon S3.
- Verify that buckets that should not allow public access
are properly configured to prevent it.
- You can apply the same review process for databases and
any other data sources that use IAM authentication, such
as SQS or third-party data stores.

- **Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer**:

You can configure [AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)
to analyze Amazon S3 buckets and generate findings when
an S3 policy grants access to an external entity.

- **Implement versioning and object
locking mechanisms**:

Use
[Amazon S3 versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) to preserve previous versions of
objects, which provides recovery from accidental
deletion or overwrites.
- Use
[Amazon S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) to provide mandatory access
control for objects, which prevents them from being
deleted or overwritten, even by the root user, until the
lock expires.
- Use
[Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html) for archives stored in
Amazon Glacier.

- **Use Amazon S3 Inventory**:

You can use
[Amazon S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) to audit and report on the
replication and encryption status of your S3 objects.

- **Review Amazon EBS and AMI sharing
permissions**:

Review your sharing permissions for
[Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.html) and
[AMI
sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharing-amis.html) to verify that your images and volumes
are not shared with AWS accounts that are external to
your workload.

- **Review AWS Resource Access Manager
Shares periodically**:

You can use
[AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to share resources, such
as AWS Network Firewall policies, Amazon Route 53
resolver rules, and subnets, within your Amazon VPCs.
- Audit shared resources regularly and stop sharing
resources that no longer need to be shared.

## Question SEC09

# SEC 9 — How do you protect your data in transit?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 3

---

# SEC09-BP01 Implement secure key and certificate management

Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates are used to secure
network communications and establish the identity of websites,
resources, and workloads over the internet, as well as private
networks.

**Desired outcome:** A secure certificate management system that
can provision, deploy, store, and renew certificates in a public key infrastructure (PKI). A
secure key and certificate management mechanism prevents certificate private key material from
disclosure and automatically renews the certificate on a periodic basis. It also integrates with other
services to provide secure network communications and identity for machine resources inside of
your workload. Key material should never be accessible to human identities.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Performing manual steps during the certificate deployment or renewal
processes.
- Paying insufficient attention to certificate authority (CA)
hierarchy when designing a private CA.
- Using self-signed certificates for public resources.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Simplify certificate management through automated deployment and
renewal
- Encourage encryption of data in transit using TLS certificates
- Increased security and auditability of certificate actions taken by
the certificate authority
- Organization of management duties at different layers of the CA
hierarchy

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Modern workloads make extensive use of encrypted network
communications using PKI protocols
such as TLS. PKI certificate management
can be complex, but automated certificate provisioning,
deployment, and renewal can reduce the friction associated with
certificate management.

AWS provides two services to manage general-purpose PKI
certificates:
[AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) and
[AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html). ACM is the
primary service that customers use to provision, manage, and
deploy certificates for use in both public-facing as well as
private AWS workloads. ACM issues private certificates using AWS Private CA and
[integrates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html)
with many other AWS managed services to provide secure TLS
certificates for workloads. ACM can also issue publicly trusted
certificates from
[Amazon
Trust Services](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/). Public certificates from ACM can be used on
public facing workloads, as modern browsers and operating systems
trust these certificates by default.

AWS Private CA allows you to
establish your own root or subordinate certificate authority and
issue TLS certificates through an API. You can use these kinds of
certificates in scenarios where you control and manage the trust
chain on the client side of the TLS connection. In addition to TLS
use cases, AWS Private CA can be used to issue certificates to
Kubernetes pods, Matter device product attestations, code signing,
and other use cases with a
[custom
template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html). You can also use
[IAM
Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to provide temporary IAM credentials to
on-premises workloads that have been issued X.509 certificates
signed by your Private CA.

In addition to ACM and AWS Private CA,
[AWS IoT Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) provides specialized support for provisioning,
managing and deploying PKI certificates to IoT
devices. AWS IoT Core provides specialized mechanisms for
[onboarding
IoT devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/device-manufacturing-provisioning/device-manufacturing-provisioning.html) into your public key infrastructure at scale.

Some AWS services, such as
[Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) and
[Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html), offer their own capabilities for using
certificates to secure application connections. For example, both
API Gateway and Application Load Balancer (ALB) support mutual TLS
(mTLS) using client certificates that you create and export using
the AWS Management Console, CLI, or APIs.

**Considerations for establishing a private CA hierarchy**

When you need to establish a private CA, it's important to take
special care to properly design the CA hierarchy upfront. It's a
best practice to deploy each level of your CA hierarchy into
separate AWS accounts when creating a private CA hierarchy. This
intentional step reduces the surface area for each level in the CA
hierarchy, making it simpler to discover anomalies in CloudTrail
log data and reducing the scope of access or impact if there is
unauthorized access to one of the accounts. The root CA should reside in its own separate account and should only be used to issue one or more intermediate CA certificates.

Then, create one or more intermediate CAs in accounts separate
from the root CA's account to issue certificates for end users,
devices, or other workloads. Finally, issue certificates from your
root CA to the intermediate CAs, which will in turn issue
certificates to your end users or devices. For more information on
planning your CA deployment and designing your CA hierarchy,
including planning for resiliency, cross-region replication,
sharing CAs across your organization, and more, see
[Planning
your AWS Private CA deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaPlanning.html).

### Implementation steps

- Determine the relevant AWS services required for your use
case:

Many use cases can leverage the existing AWS public key
infrastructure using
[AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html). ACM can
be used to deploy TLS certificates for web servers, load
balancers, or other uses for publicly trusted certificates.
- Consider [AWS Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) when you need
to establish your own private certificate authority
hierarchy or need access to exportable certificates. ACM can then be used to issue [many types
of end-entity certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaIssueCert.html) using the AWS Private CA.
- For use cases where certificates must be provisioned at
scale for embedded Internet of things (IoT) devices,
consider [AWS IoT Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html).
- Consider using native mTLS functionality in services
like
[Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) or
[Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).

- Implement automated certificate renewal whenever possible:

Use [ACM managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/managed-renewal.html) for
certificates issued by ACM along with
integrated AWS managed services.

- Establish logging and audit trails:

Enable
[CloudTrail
logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCtIntro.html) to track access to the accounts holding
certificate authorities. Consider configuring log file
integrity validation in CloudTrail to verify the
authenticity of the log data.
- Periodically generate and review
[audit
reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaAuditReport.html) that list the certificates that your private
CA has issued or revoked. These reports can be exported to
an S3 bucket.
- When deploying a private CA, you will also need to establish
an S3 bucket to store the Certificate Revocation List (CRL).
For guidance on configuring this S3 bucket based on your
workload's requirements, see
[Planning
a certificate revocation list (CRL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html).

# SEC09-BP02 Enforce encryption in transit

Enforce your defined encryption requirements based on your organization’s policies, regulatory obligations and standards to help meet organizational, legal, and compliance requirements. Only use protocols with encryption when transmitting sensitive data outside of your virtual private cloud (VPC). Encryption helps maintain data confidentiality even when the data transits untrusted networks.

**Desired outcome:** You encrypt
network traffic between your resources and the internet to mitigate
unauthorized access to the data. You encrypt network traffic within
your internal AWS environment according to your security
requirements. You encrypt data in transit using secure TLS protocols
and cipher suites.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using deprecated versions of SSL, TLS, and cipher suite components (for example, SSL v3.0, 1024-bit RSA keys, and RC4 cipher).
- Allowing unencrypted (HTTP) traffic to or from public-facing resources.
- Not monitoring and replacing X.509 certificates prior to expiration.
- Using self-signed X.509 certificates for TLS.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

AWS services provide HTTPS endpoints using TLS for communication,
providing encryption in transit when communicating with the AWS
APIs. Insecure HTTP protocols can be audited and blocked in a
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) through the use of security groups.
HTTP requests can also be
[automatically
redirected to HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in Amazon CloudFront or on an
[Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html#redirect-actions). You can use an
[Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/enforcing-encryption-in-transit-with-tls1-2-or-higher-with-amazon-s3/) to
restrict the ability to upload objects through HTTP, effectively
enforcing the use of HTTPS for object uploads to your bucket(s).
You have full control over your computing resources to implement
encryption in transit across your services. Additionally, you can
use VPN connectivity into your VPC from an external network or
[AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) to facilitate encryption of traffic. Verify
that your clients make calls to AWS APIs using at least TLS 1.2,
as
[AWS has deprecated the use of earlier versions of TLS as of February
2024](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tls-1-2-required-for-aws-endpoints/). We recommend you use TLS 1.3. If you have special
requirements for encryption in transit, you can find third-party
solutions available in the AWS Marketplace.

### Implementation steps

- **Enforce encryption in transit:** Your defined encryption requirements should be based on the latest standards and best practices and only allow secure protocols. For example, configure a security group to only allow the HTTPS protocol to an application load balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.
- **Configure secure protocols in edge services:** [Configure HTTPS with Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https.html) and use a [security profile appropriate for your security posture and use case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers).
- **Use a [VPN for external connectivity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html):** Consider using an IPsec VPN for securing point-to-point or network-to-network connections to help provide both data privacy and integrity.
- **Configure secure protocols in load balancers:** Select a security policy that provides the strongest cipher suites supported by the clients that will be connecting to the listener. [Create an HTTPS listener for your Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html).
- **Configure secure protocols in Amazon Redshift:** Configure your cluster to require a [secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html).
- **Configure secure protocols:** Review AWS service documentation to determine encryption-in-transit capabilities.
- **Configure secure access when uploading to Amazon S3 buckets:** Use Amazon S3 bucket policy controls to [enforce secure access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html) to data.
- **Consider using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/):** ACM allows you to provision, manage, and deploy public TLS certificates for use with AWS services.
- **Consider using [AWS Private Certificate Authority](https://aws.amazon.com/private-ca/) for private PKI needs:** AWS Private CA allows you to create private certificate authority (CA) hierarchies to issue end-entity X.509 certificates that can be used to create encrypted TLS channels.

# SEC09-BP03 Authenticate network communications

Verify the identity of communications by using protocols that
support authentication, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or
IPsec.

Design your workload to use secure, authenticated network protocols whenever communicating between services, applications, or to users. Using network protocols that support authentication and authorization provides stronger control over network flows and reduces the impact of unauthorized access.

**Desired outcome:** A workload with well-defined data plane and control plane traffic flows between services. The traffic flows use authenticated and encrypted network protocols where technically feasible.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Unencrypted or unauthenticated traffic flows within your workload.
- Reusing authentication credentials across multiple users or entities.
- Relying solely on network controls as an access control mechanism.
- Creating a custom authentication mechanism rather than relying on industry-standard authentication mechanisms.
- Overly permissive traffic flows between service components or other resources in the VPC.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Limits the scope of impact for unauthorized access to one part of the workload.
- Provides a higher level of assurance that actions are only performed by authenticated entities.
- Improves decoupling of services by clearly defining and enforcing intended data transfer interfaces.
- Enhances monitoring, logging, and incident response through request attribution and well-defined communication interfaces.
- Provides defense-in-depth for your workloads by combining network controls with authentication and authorization controls.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Your workload’s network traffic patterns can be characterized into two categories:

- *East-west traffic* represents traffic flows between services that make up a workload.
- *North-south traffic* represents traffic flows between your workload and consumers.

While it is common practice to encrypt north-south traffic, securing east-west traffic using authenticated protocols is less common. Modern security practices recommend that network design alone does not grant a trusted relationship between two entities. When two services may reside within a common network boundary, it is still best practice to encrypt, authenticate, and authorize communications between those services.

As an example, AWS service APIs use the [AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html) signature protocol to authenticate the caller, no matter what network the request originates from. This authentication ensures that AWS APIs can verify the identity that requested the action, and that identity can then be combined with policies to make an authorization decision to determine whether the action should be allowed or not.

Services such as [Amazon VPC Lattice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/access-management-overview.html) and [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/permissions.html) allow you use the same SigV4 signature protocol to add authentication and authorization to east-west traffic in your own workloads. If resources outside of your AWS environment need to communicate with services that require SigV4-based authentication and authorization, you can use [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) on the non-AWS resource to acquire temporary AWS credentials. These credentials can be used to sign requests to services using SigV4 to authorize access.

Another common mechanism for authenticating east-west traffic is
TLS mutual authentication (mTLS). Many Internet of Things (IoT),
business-to-business applications, and microservices use mTLS to
validate the identity of both sides of a TLS communication through
the use of both client and server-side X.509 certificates. These
certificates can be issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority
(AWS Private CA). You can use services such as
[Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html) to provide mTLS authentication for inter- or
intra-workload communication.
[Application Load Balancer also supports mTLS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/mutual-authentication.html) for internal or external
facing workloads. While mTLS provides authentication information
for both sides of a TLS communication, it does not provide a
mechanism for authorization.

Finally, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are two protocols typically used for controlling access to services by users, but are now becoming popular for service-to-service traffic as well. API Gateway provides a [JSON Web Token (JWT) authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html), allowing workloads to restrict access to API routes using JWTs issued from OIDC or OAuth 2.0 identity providers. OAuth2 scopes can be used as a source for basic authorization decisions, but the authorization checks still need to be implemented in the application layer, and OAuth2 scopes alone cannot support more complex authorization needs.

### Implementation steps

- **Define and document your workload network flows:** The first step in implementing a defense-in-depth strategy is defining your workload’s traffic flows.

Create a data flow diagram that clearly defines how data is transmitted between different services that comprise your workload. This diagram is the first step to enforcing those flows through authenticated network channels.
- Instrument your workload in development and testing phases to validate that the data flow diagram accurately reflects the workload’s behavior at runtime.
- A data flow diagram can also be useful when performing a threat modeling exercise, as described in [SEC01-BP07 Identify threats and prioritize mitigations using a threat model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html).

- **Establish network controls:** Consider AWS capabilities to establish network controls aligned to your data flows. While network boundaries should not be the only security control, they provide a layer in the defense-in-depth strategy to protect your workload.

Use [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-groups.html) to establish define and restrict data flows between resources.
- Consider using [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html) to communicate with both AWS and third-party services that support AWS PrivateLink. Data sent through a AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint stays within the AWS network backbone and does not traverse the public Internet.

- **Implement authentication and authorization across services in your workload:** Choose the set of AWS services most appropriate to provide authenticated, encrypted traffic flows in your workload.

Consider [Amazon VPC Lattice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/what-is-vpc-lattice.html) to secure service-to-service communication. VPC Lattice can use [SigV4 authentication combined with auth policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/auth-policies.html) to control service-to-service access.
- For service-to-service communication using mTLS,
consider
[API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html),
[Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/mutual-authentication.html).
[AWS Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) can be used to establish a private CA
hierarchy capable of issuing certificates for use with
mTLS.
- When integrating with services using OAuth 2.0 or OIDC, consider [API Gateway using the JWT authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html).
- For communication between your workload and IoT devices, consider [AWS IoT Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/client-authentication.html), which provides several options for network traffic encryption and authentication.

- **Monitor for unauthorized access:** Continually monitor for unintended communication channels, unauthorized principals attempting to access protected resources, and other improper access patterns.

If using VPC Lattice to manage access to your services, consider enabling and monitoring [VPC Lattice access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/monitoring-access-logs.html). These access logs include information on the requesting entity, network information including source and destination VPC, and request metadata.
- Consider enabling [VPC flow logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) to capture metadata on network flows and periodically review for anomalies.
- Refer to the [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.html) and the [Incident Response section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/incident-response.html) of the AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar for more guidance on planning, simulating, and responding to security incidents.

## Question SEC10

# SEC 10 — How do you anticipate, respond to, and recover from incidents?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 8

---

# SEC10-BP01 Identify key personnel and external resources

Identify internal and external personnel, resources, and legal
obligations to help your organization respond to an incident.

**Desired outcome:** You have a list
of key personnel, their contact information, and the roles they play
when responding to a security event. You review this information
regularly and update it to reflect personnel changes from an
internal and external tools perspective. You consider all
third-party service providers and vendors while documenting this
information, including security partners, cloud providers, and
software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. During a security event,
personnel are available with the appropriate level of
responsibility, context, and access to be able to respond and
recover.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not maintaining an updated list of key personnel with contact
information, their roles, and their responsibilities when
responding to security events.
- Assuming that everyone understands the people, dependencies,
infrastructure, and solutions when responding to and recovering
from an event.
- Not having a document or knowledge repository that represents
key infrastructure or application design.
- Not having proper onboarding processes for new employees to
effectively contribute to a security event response, such as
conducting event simulations.
- Not having an escalation path in place when key personnel are
temporarily unavailable or fail to respond during security
events.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** This practice reduces the triage and response
time spent on identifying the right personnel and their roles during
an event. Minimize wasted time during an event by maintaining an
updated list of key personnel and their roles so you can bring the
right individuals to triage and recover from an event.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

**Identify key personnel in your organization:** Maintain a contact
list of personnel within your organization that you need to
involve. Regularly review and update this information in the event
of personnel movement, like organizational changes, promotions,
and team changes. This is especially important for key roles like
incident managers, incident responders, and communications lead.

- **Incident manager:** Incident managers have overall authority
during the event response.
- **Incident responders:** Incident responders are responsible for
investigation and remediation activities. These people can
differ based on the type of event, but are typically
developers and operation teams responsible for the impacted
application.
- **Communications lead:** The communications lead is responsible
for internal and external communications, especially with
public agencies, regulators, and customers.
- **Onboarding process:** Regularly train and onboard new employees
to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to
contribute effectively to incident response efforts.
Incorporate simulations and hands-on exercises as part of the
onboarding process to facilitate their preparedness
- **Subject matter experts (SMEs):** In the case of distributed and
autonomous teams, we recommend you identify an SME for mission
critical workloads. They offer insights into the operation and
data classification of critical workloads involved in the
event.

Example table format:

```
`| Role | Name | Contact Information | Responsibilities |
1 | ——– | ——- | ——- | ——- |
2 | Incident Manager | Jane Doe| jane.doe@example.com | Overall authority during response |
3 | Incident Responder | John Smith | john.smith@example.com | Investigation and remediation |
4 | Communications Lead | Emily Johnson | emily.johnson@example.com | Internal and external communications |
5 | Communications Lead | Michael Brown | michael.brown@example.com | Insights on critical workloads |`
```

Consider using
the [AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-incident-manager.html) feature to capture key
contacts, define a response plan, automate on-call schedules, and
create escalation plans. Automate and rotate all staff through an
on-call schedule, so that responsibility for the workload is
shared across its owners. This promotes good practices, such as
emitting relevant metrics and logs as well as defining alarm
thresholds that matter for the workload.

**Identify external
partners:** Enterprises use tools built by independent
software vendors (ISVs), partners, and subcontractors to build
differentiating solutions for their customers. Engage key
personnel from these parties who can help respond to and recover
from an incident. We recommend you sign up for the appropriate
level of Support in order to get prompt access to AWS subject
matter experts through a support case. Consider similar
arrangements with all critical solutions providers for the
workloads. Some security events require publicly listed businesses
to notify relevant public agencies and regulators of the event and
impacts. Maintain and update contact information for the relevant
departments and responsible individuals.

## Implementation steps

- Set up an incident management solution.

Consider deploying Incident Manager in your Security
Tooling account.

- Define contacts in your incident management solution.

Define at least two types of contact channels for each
contact (such as SMS, phone, or email), to ensure
reachability during an incident.

- Define a response plan.

Identify the most appropriate contacts to engage during an
incident. Define escalation plans aligned to the roles of
personnel to be engaged, rather than individual contacts.
Consider including contacts that may be responsible for
informing external entities, even if they are not directly
engaged to resolve the incident.

# SEC10-BP02 Develop incident management plans

The first document to develop for incident response is the incident response plan. The incident response plan is designed to be the foundation for your incident response program and strategy.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**
Developing thorough and clearly defined incident response processes is key to a successful and scalable incident response program. When a security event occurs, clear steps and workflows can help you to respond in a timely manner. You might already have existing incident response processes. Regardless of your current state, it’s important to update, iterate, and test your incident response processes regularly.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

An incident management plan is critical to respond, mitigate, and recover from the potential impact of security incidents. An incident management plan is a structured process for identifying, remediating, and responding in a timely matter to security incidents.

The cloud has many of the same operational roles and requirements
found in an on-premises environment. When you create an incident
management plan, it is important to factor response and recovery
strategies that best align with your business outcome and
compliance requirements. For example, if you operate workloads in
AWS that are FedRAMP compliant in the United States, follow the
recommendations in
[NIST
SP 800-61 Computer Security Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf). Similarly, when
you operate workloads that store personally identifiable
information (PII), consider how to protect and respond to issues
related to data residency and use.

When building an incident management plan for your workloads in AWS, start
with the [AWS Shared Responsibility
Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) for building a defense-in-depth approach towards incident response. In this
model, AWS manages security of the cloud, and you are responsible for security in the cloud.
This means that you retain control and are responsible for the security controls you choose to
implement. The [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/welcome.html) details key concepts and foundational
guidance for building a cloud-centric incident management plan.

An effective incident management plan must be continually iterated upon, remaining current
with your cloud operations goal. Consider using the implementation plans detailed below as
you create and evolve your incident management plan.

### Implementation steps

- Define roles and responsibilities within your organization
for handling security events. This should involve
representatives from various departments, including:

Human resources (HR)
- Executive team
- Legal department
- Application owners and developers (subject matter
experts, or SMEs)

- Clearly outline who is responsible, accountable, consulted,
and informed (RACI) during an incident. Create a RACI chart
to facilitate quick and direct communication, and clearly
outline the leadership across different stages of an event.
- Involve application owners and developers (SMEs) during an
incident, as they can provide valuable information and
context to aid in measuring the impact. Build relationships
with these SMEs, and practice incident response scenarios
with them before an actual incident occurs.
- Involve trusted partners or external experts in the
investigation or response process, as they can provide
additional expertise and perspective.
- Align your incident management plans and roles with any
local regulations or compliance requirements that govern
your organization.
- Practice and test your incident response plans regularly,
and involve all the defined roles and responsibilities. This
helps streamline the process and verify you have a
coordinated and efficient response to security incidents.
- Review and update the roles, responsibilities, and RACI
chart periodically, or as your organizational structure or
requirements change.

**Understand AWS response teams and support**

- **AWS Support**

[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support the success and operational health of your AWS solutions. If you need technical support and more resources to help plan, deploy, and optimize your AWS environment, you can select a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.
- Consider the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support) in AWS Management Console (sign-in required) as the central point of contact to get support for issues that affect your AWS resources. Access to Support is controlled by AWS Identity and Access Management. For more information about getting access to Support features, see [Getting started with Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#accessing-support).

- **AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT)**

The AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a specialized 24/7 global AWS team that provides support to customers during active security events on the customer side of the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
- When the AWS CIRT supports you, they provide assistance with triage and recovery for an active security event on AWS. They can assist in root cause analysis through the use of AWS service logs and provide you with recommendations for recovery. They can also provide security recommendations and best practices to help you avoid security events in the future.
- AWS customers can engage the AWS CIRT through an [Support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html).

- [AWS Security Incident Response](https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/)

Announced at re:Invent 2024, AWS Security Incident Response is a managed security incident response service that uses both modern triage technology and a human in the loop. The service ingests all GuardDuty findings and any third-party findings sent to AWS Security Hub CSPM for triage to alert the customer only on findings that require an investigation. The service also provides a portal to submit reactive cases in the event of a security event the customer notices and receive support from AWS' advanced incident response team.

- **DDoS response support**

AWS offers [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/), which provides a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS. Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that can minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There are two tiers of Shield: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. To learn about the differences between these two tiers, see [Shield features documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/features/).

- **AWS Managed Services (AMS)**

[AWS Managed Services (AMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-services/) provides ongoing management of your AWS infrastructure so you can focus on your applications. By implementing best practices to maintain your infrastructure, AMS helps reduce your operational overhead and risk. AMS automates common activities such as change requests, monitoring, patch management, security, and backup services, and provides full-lifecycle services to provision, run, and support your infrastructure.
- AMS takes responsibility for deploying a suite of security detective controls and provides a 24/7 first line of response to alerts. When an alert is initiated, AMS follows a standard set of automated and manual playbooks to verify a consistent response. These playbooks are shared with AMS customers during onboarding so that they can develop and coordinate a response with AMS.

**Develop the incident response plan**

The incident response plan is designed to be the foundation for your incident response program and strategy. The incident response plan should be in a formal document. An incident response plan typically includes these sections:

- **An incident response team overview:** Outlines the goals and functions of the incident response team.
- **Roles and responsibilities:** Lists the incident response stakeholders and details their roles when an incident occurs.
- **A communication plan:** Details contact information and how you communicate during an incident.
- **Backup communication methods:** It’s a best practice to have out-of-band communication as a backup for incident communication. An example of an application that provides a secure out-of-band communications channel is AWS Wickr.
- **Phases of incident response and actions to take:** Enumerates the phases of incident response (for example, detect, analyze, eradicate, contain, and recover), including high-level actions to take within those phases.
- **Incident severity and prioritization definitions:** Details how to classify the severity of an incident, how to prioritize the incident, and then how the severity definitions affect escalation procedures.

While these sections are common throughout companies of different sizes and industries, each organization’s incident response plan is unique. You need to build an incident response plan that works best for your organization.

# SEC10-BP03 Prepare forensic capabilities

Ahead of a security incident, consider developing forensics capabilities to support security event investigations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

Concepts from traditional on-premises forensics apply to AWS. For key information to start building forensics capabilities in the AWS Cloud, see [Forensic investigation environment strategies in the AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/forensic-investigation-environment-strategies-in-the-aws-cloud/).

Once you have your environment and AWS account structure set up for forensics, define the technologies required to effectively perform forensically sound methodologies across the four phases:

- **Collection:** Collect relevant AWS logs, such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, VPC Flow Logs, and host-level logs. Collect snapshots, backups, and memory dumps of impacted AWS resources where available.
- **Examination:** Examine the data collected by extracting and assessing the relevant information.
- **Analysis:** Analyze the data collected in order to understand the incident and draw conclusions from it.
- **Reporting:** Present the information resulting from the analysis phase.

## Implementation steps

**Prepare your forensics environment**

[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) helps you centrally manage and govern an AWS environment as you grow and scale AWS resources. An AWS organization consolidates your AWS accounts so that you can administer them as a single unit. You can use organizational units (OUs) to group accounts together to administer as a single unit.

For incident response, it’s helpful to have an AWS account structure that supports the functions of incident response, which includes a *security OU* and a *forensics OU*. Within the security OU, you should have accounts for:

- **Log archival:** Aggregate logs in a log archival AWS account with limited permissions.
- **Security tools:** Centralize security services in a security tool AWS account. This account operates as the delegated administrator for security services.

Within the forensics OU, you have the option to implement a single forensics account or accounts for each Region that you operate in, depending on which works best for your business and operational model. If you create a forensics account per Region, you can block the creation of AWS resources outside of that Region and reduce the risk of resources being copied to an unintended region. For example, if you only operate in US East (N. Virginia) Region (`us-east-1`) and US West (Oregon) (`us-west-2`), then you would have two accounts in the forensics OU: one for `us-east-1` and one for `us-west-2`.

You can create a forensics AWS account for multiple Regions. You should exercise caution in copying AWS resources to that account to verify you’re aligning with your data sovereignty requirements. Because it takes time to provision new accounts, it is imperative to create and instrument the forensics accounts well ahead of an incident so that responders can be prepared to effectively use them for response.

The following diagram displays a sample account structure including a forensics OU with per-Region forensics accounts:

*Per-Region account structure for incident response*

**Capture backups and snapshots**

Setting up backups of key systems and databases are critical for recovering from a security incident and for forensics purposes. With backups in place, you can restore your systems to their previous safe state. On AWS, you can take snapshots of various resources. Snapshots provide you with point-in-time backups of those resources. There are many AWS services that can support you in backup and recovery. For detail on these services and approaches for backup and recovery, see [Backup and Recovery Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/backup-recovery/services.html) and [Use backups to recover from security incidents](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-backups-to-recover-from-security-incidents/).

Especially when it comes to situations such as ransomware, it’s critical for your backups to be well protected. For guidance on securing your backups, see [Top 10 security best practices for securing backups in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/top-10-security-best-practices-for-securing-backups-in-aws/). In addition to securing your backups, you should regularly test your backup and restore processes to verify that the technology and processes you have in place work as expected.

**Automate forensics**

During a security event, your incident response team must be able to collect and analyze evidence quickly while maintaining accuracy for the time period surrounding the event (such as capturing logs related to a specific event or resource or collecting memory dump of an Amazon EC2 instance). It’s both challenging and time consuming for the incident response team to manually collect the relevant evidence, especially across a large number of instances and accounts. Additionally, manual collection can be prone to human error. For these reasons, you should develop and implement automation for forensics as much as possible.

AWS offers a number of automation resources for forensics, which are listed in the following Resources section. These resources are examples of forensics patterns that we have developed and customers have implemented. While they might be a useful reference architecture to start with, consider modifying them or creating new forensics automation patterns based on your environment, requirements, tools, and forensics processes.

# SEC10-BP04 Develop and test security incident response playbooks

A key part of preparing your incident response processes is
developing playbooks. Incident response playbooks provide
prescriptive guidance and steps to follow when a security event
occurs. Having clear structure and steps simplifies the response and
reduces the likelihood for human error.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Playbooks should be created for incident scenarios such as:

- **Expected incidents**:
Playbooks should be created for incidents you anticipate. This
includes threats like denial of service (DoS), ransomware, and
credential compromise.
- **Known security findings or
alerts**: Playbooks should be created to address your
known security findings and alerts, such as those from Amazon GuardDuty. When you receive a GuardDuty finding, the playbook
should provide clear steps to prevent mishandling or ignoring
the alert. For more remediation details and guidance, see
[Remediating
security issues discovered by GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_remediate.html).

Playbooks should contain technical steps for a security analyst to
complete in order to adequately investigate and respond to a
potential security incident.

AWS' Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) has published a [GitHub repository containing incident response playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/main/docs), organized by threat scenario, type, and resource. These playbooks can be adapted to align with your existing incident response procedures or serve as a foundation for developing new ones.

### Implementation steps

Items to include in a playbook include:

- **Playbook overview**: What
risk or incident scenario does this playbook address? What
is the goal of the playbook?
- **Prerequisites**: What logs,
detection mechanisms, and automated tools are required for
this incident scenario? What is the expected notification?
- **Communication and escalation
information**: Who is involved and what is their
contact information? What are each of the stakeholders’
responsibilities?
- **Response steps**: Across
phases of incident response, what tactical steps should be
taken? What queries should an analyst run? What code should
be run to achieve the desired outcome?

**Detect**: How will the
incident be detected?
- **Analyze**: How will the
scope of impact be determined?
- **Contain**: How will the
incident be isolated to limit scope?
- **Eradicate**: How will
the threat be removed from the environment?
- **Recover**: How will the
affected system or resource be brought back into
production?

- **Expected outcomes**: After
queries and code are run, what is the expected result of the
playbook?

# SEC10-BP05 Pre-provision access

Verify that incident responders have the correct access pre-provisioned in AWS to reduce
the time needed for investigation through to recovery.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using the root account for incident response.
- Altering existing accounts.
- Manipulating IAM permissions directly when providing just-in-time privilege elevation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

AWS recommends reducing or eliminating reliance on long-lived credentials wherever
possible, in favor of temporary credentials and *just-in-time* privilege escalation
mechanisms. Long-lived credentials are prone to security risk and increase operational
overhead. For most management tasks, as well as incident response tasks, we recommend you implement [identity federation](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/)
alongside [temporary
escalation for administrative access](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/managing-temporary-elevated-access-to-your-aws-environment/). In this model, a user requests elevation to a
higher level of privilege (such as an incident response role) and, provided the user
is eligible for elevation, a request is sent to an approver. If the request is approved,
the user receives a set of temporary [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) which can be used to complete their
tasks. After these credentials expire, the user must submit a new elevation request.

We recommend the use of temporary privilege escalation in the majority of incident response scenarios. The correct way to do this is to use the
[AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) and [session policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
to scope access.

There are scenarios where federated identities are unavailable, such as:

- Outage related to a compromised identity provider (IdP).
- Misconfiguration or human error causing broken federated access management system.
- Malicious activity such as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) event or rendering unavailability of the system.

In the preceding cases, there should be emergency *break glass* access configured to allow
investigation and timely remediation of incidents. We recommend that you use a [user,
group, or role with appropriate permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials) to perform tasks and access AWS resources. Use the root user only for
[tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html).
To verify that incident responders have the correct level of access to AWS and other relevant systems, we recommend the pre-provisioning
of dedicated accounts. The accounts require privileged access, and must be
tightly controlled and monitored. The accounts must be built with the fewest privileges
required to perform the necessary tasks, and the level of access should be based on the
playbooks created as part of the incident management plan.

Use purpose-built and dedicated users and roles as a best practice. Temporarily escalating
user or role access through the addition of IAM policies both makes it unclear what access
users had during the incident, and risks the escalated privileges not being revoked.

It is important to remove as many dependencies as possible to verify that access can be
gained under the widest possible number of failure scenarios. To support this, create a
playbook to verify that incident response users are created as
users in a dedicated security account, and not managed through any existing Federation or
single sign-on (SSO) solution. Each individual responder must have their own named account.
The account configuration must enforce [strong password policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
If the incident response playbooks only require access to the AWS Management Console, the user should not
have access keys configured and should be explicitly disallowed from creating access keys.
This can be configured with IAM policies or service control policies (SCPs) as mentioned in
the AWS Security Best Practices for [AWS Organizations SCPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). The users should have no privileges
other than the ability to assume incident response roles in other accounts.

During an incident it might be necessary to grant access to other internal or external individuals
to support investigation, remediation, or recovery activities. In this case, use the playbook
mechanism mentioned previously, and there must be a process to verify that any additional access is
revoked immediately after the incident is complete.

To verify that the use of incident response roles can be properly monitored and audited,
it is essential that the IAM accounts created for this purpose are not shared between
individuals, and that the AWS account root user is not used unless [required for a specific
task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html). If the root user is required (for example, IAM access to a specific account is unavailable),
use a separate process with a playbook available to verify availability of the root user sign-in credentials and
MFA token.

To configure the IAM policies for the incident response roles, consider using [IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html)
to generate policies based on AWS CloudTrail logs. To do this, grant administrator access to the
incident response role on a non-production account and run through your playbooks. Once
complete, a policy can be created that allows only the actions taken. This policy can then be
applied to all the incident response roles across all accounts. You might wish to create a separate
IAM policy for each playbook to allow easier management and auditing. Example playbooks could
include response plans for ransomware, data breaches, loss of production access, and other
scenarios.

Use the incident response accounts to assume dedicated incident response [IAM roles in
other AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html). These roles must be configured to only be assumable by users in the
security account, and the trust relationship must require that the calling principal has
authenticated using MFA. The roles must use tightly-scoped IAM policies to control access.
Ensure that all `AssumeRole` requests for these roles are logged in CloudTrail and alerted
on, and that any actions taken using these roles are logged.

It is strongly recommended that both the IAM accounts and the IAM roles are
clearly named to allow them to be easily found in CloudTrail logs. An example of this would be to
name the IAM accounts ``-BREAK-GLASS and
the IAM roles `BREAK-GLASS-ROLE`.

[CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) is used to log API activity in your AWS accounts and should be used to [configure
alerts on usage of the incident response roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-notifications-when-your-aws-accounts-root-access-keys-are-used/). Refer to the blog post on configuring alerts
when root keys are used. The instructions can be modified to configure the [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metric
filter-to-filter on `AssumeRole` events related to the incident response IAM role:

```
`{ $.eventName = "AssumeRole" && $.requestParameters.roleArn = "`" && $.userIdentity.invokedBy NOT EXISTS && $.eventType != "AwsServiceEvent" }
```

As the incident response roles are likely to have a high level of access, it is important
that these alerts go to a wide group and are acted upon promptly.

During an incident, it is possible that a responder might require access to systems which are
not directly secured by IAM. These could include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, or
software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms. It is strongly recommended that rather than using
native protocols such as SSH or RDP, [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) is used for all
administrative access to Amazon EC2 instances. This access can be controlled using IAM, which is
secure and audited. It might also be possible to automate parts of your playbooks using
[AWS Systems Manager Run Command documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/execute-remote-commands.html), which can reduce user error and improve
time to recovery. For access to databases and third-party tools, we recommend storing
access credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and granting access to the incident responder
roles.

Finally, the management of the incident response IAM accounts should be added to your
[Joiners, Movers, and Leavers processes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html) and reviewed and tested periodically to verify that
only the intended access is allowed.

# SEC10-BP06 Pre-deploy tools

Verify that security personnel have the right tools pre-deployed to reduce the time for investigation through to recovery.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To automate security response and operations functions, you can use a comprehensive set of APIs and tools from AWS. You can fully automate identity management, network security, data protection, and monitoring capabilities and deliver them using popular software development methods that you already have in place. When you build security automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response, rather than having people monitor your security position and manually react to events.

If your incident response teams continue to respond to alerts in the same way, they risk alert fatigue. Over time, the team can become desensitized to alerts and can either make mistakes handling ordinary situations or miss unusual alerts. Automation helps avoid alert fatigue by using functions that process the repetitive and ordinary alerts, leaving humans to handle the sensitive and unique incidents. Integrating anomaly detection systems, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail Insights, and Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, can reduce the burden of common threshold-based alerts.

You can improve manual processes by programmatically automating steps in the process. After you define the remediation pattern to an event, you can decompose that pattern into actionable logic, and write the code to perform that logic. Responders can then run that code to remediate the issue. Over time, you can automate more and more steps, and ultimately automatically handle whole classes of common incidents.

During a security investigation, you need to be able to review relevant logs to record and understand the full scope and timeline of the incident. Logs are also required for alert generation, indicating certain actions of interest have happened. It is critical to select, enable, store, and set up querying and retrieval mechanisms, and set up alerting. Additionally, an effective way to provide tools to search log data is [Amazon Detective](https://aws.amazon.com/detective/).

AWS oﬀers over 200 cloud services and thousands of features. We recommend that you review the services that can support and simplify your incident response strategy.

In addition to logging, you should develop and implement a [tagging strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html). Tagging can help provide context around the purpose of an AWS resource. Tagging can also be used for automation.

### Implementation steps

**Select and set up logs for analysis and alerting**

See the following documentation on configuring logging for incident response:

- [Logging strategies for security incident response](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/logging-strategies-for-security-incident-response/)
- [SEC04-BP01 Configure service and application logging](./sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html)

**Enable security services to support detection and response**

AWS provides detective, preventative, and responsive capabilities, and other services can be used to architect custom security solutions. For a list of the most relevant services for security incident response, see [Cloud capability definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/appendix-a-cloud-capability-definitions.html) and the [Security Incident Response home page](https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/).

**Develop and implement a tagging strategy**

Obtaining contextual information on the business use case and relevant internal stakeholders surrounding an AWS resource can be difficult. One way to do this is in the form of tags, which assign metadata to your AWS resources and consist of a user-defined key and value. You can create tags to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, type of data processed, and other criteria of your choice.

Having a consistent tagging strategy can speed up response times and minimize time spent on organizational context by allowing you to quickly identify and discern contextual information about an AWS resource. Tags can also serve as a mechanism to initiate response automations. For more detail on what to tag, see [Tagging your AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html). You’ll want to first define the tags you want to implement across your organization. After that, you’ll implement and enforce this tagging strategy.

# SEC10-BP07 Run simulations

As organizations grow and evolve over time, so does the threat landscape, making it important to continually review your incident response capabilities. Running simulations (also known as game days) is one method that can be used to perform this assessment. Simulations use real-world security event scenarios designed to mimic a threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and allow an organization to exercise and evaluate their incident response capabilities by responding to these mock cyber events as they might occur in reality.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Simulations have a variety of benefits:

- Validating cyber readiness and developing the confidence of your incident responders.
- Testing the accuracy and efficiency of tools and workflows.
- Refining communication and escalation methods aligned with your incident response plan.
- Providing an opportunity to respond to less common vectors.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

There are three main types of simulations:

- **Tabletop exercises:** The tabletop approach to simulations is a discussion-based session involving the various incident response stakeholders to practice roles and responsibilities and use established communication tools and playbooks. Exercise facilitation can typically be accomplished in a full day in a virtual venue, physical venue, or a combination. Because it is discussion-based, the tabletop exercise focuses on processes, people, and collaboration. Technology is an integral part of the discussion, but the actual use of incident response tools or scripts is generally not a part of the tabletop exercise.
- **Purple team exercises:** Purple team exercises increase the level of collaboration between the incident responders (blue team) and simulated threat actors (red team). The blue team is comprised of members of the security operations center (SOC), but can also include other stakeholders that would be involved during an actual cyber event. The red team is comprised of a penetration testing team or key stakeholders that are trained in offensive security. The red team works collaboratively with the exercise facilitators when designing a scenario so that the scenario is accurate and feasible. During purple team exercises, the primary focus is on the detection mechanisms, the tools, and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) supporting the incident response efforts.
- **Red team exercises:** During a red team exercise, the offense (red team) conducts a simulation to achieve a certain objective or set of objectives from a predetermined scope. The defenders (blue team) will not necessarily have knowledge of the scope and duration of the exercise, which provides a more realistic assessment of how they would respond to an actual incident. Because red team exercises can be invasive tests, be cautious and implement controls to verify that the exercise does not cause actual harm to your environment.

Consider facilitating cyber simulations at a regular interval. Each exercise type can provide unique benefits to the participants and the organization as a whole, so you might choose to start with less complex simulation types (such as tabletop exercises) and progress to more complex simulation types (red team exercises). You should select a simulation type based on your security maturity, resources, and your desired outcomes. Some customers might not choose to perform red team exercises due to complexity and cost.

## Implementation steps

Regardless of the type of simulation you choose, simulations generally follow these implementation steps:

- **Define core exercise elements:** Define the simulation scenario and the objectives of the simulation. Both of these should have leadership acceptance.
- **Identify key stakeholders:** At a minimum, an exercise needs exercise facilitators and participants. Depending on the scenario, additional stakeholders such as legal, communications, or executive leadership might be involved.
- **Build and test the scenario:** The scenario might need to be redefined as it is being built if specific elements aren’t feasible. A finalized scenario is expected as the output of this stage.
- **Facilitate the simulation:** The type of simulation determines the facilitation used (a paper-based scenario compared to a highly technical, simulated scenario). The facilitators should align their facilitation tactics to the exercise objects and they should engage all exercise participants wherever possible to provide the most benefit.
- **Develop the after-action report (AAR):** Identify areas that went well, those that can use improvement, and potential gaps. The AAR should measure the effectiveness of the simulation as well as the team’s response to the simulated event so that progress can be tracked over time with future simulations.

# SEC10-BP08 Establish a framework for learning from incidents

Implementing a *lessons learned* framework and
root cause analysis capability can not only help improve incident
response capabilities, but also help prevent the incident from
recurring. By learning from each incident, you can help avoid
repeating the same mistakes, exposures, or misconfigurations, not
only improving your security posture, but also minimizing time lost
to preventable situations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

It's important to implement a *lessons learned*
framework that establishes and achieves, at a
high level, the following points:

- When is a lessons learned held?
- What is involved in the lessons learned process?
- How is a lessons learned performed?
- Who is involved in the process and how?
- How will areas of improvement be identified?
- How will you ensure improvements are effectively tracked and
implemented?

The framework should not focus on or blame individuals, but
instead should focus on improving tools and processes.

### Implementation steps

Aside from the preceding high-level outcomes listed, it’s important
to make sure that you ask the right questions to derive the most
value (information that leads to actionable improvements) from
the process. Consider these questions to help get you started in
fostering your lessons learned discussions:

- What was the incident?
- When was the incident first identified?
- How was it identified?
- What systems alerted on the activity?
- What systems, services, and data were involved?
- What specifically occurred?
- What worked well?
- What didn't work well?
- Which process or procedures failed or failed to scale to
respond to the incident?
- What can be improved within the following areas:

**People**

Were the people who were needed to be contacted
actually available and was the contact list up to
date?
- Were people missing training or capabilities needed
to effectively respond and investigate the incident?
- Were the appropriate resources ready and available?

- **Process**

Were processes and procedures followed?
- Were processes and procedures documented and
available for this (type of) incident?
- Were required processes and procedures missing?
- Were the responders able to gain timely access to
the required information to respond to the issue?

- **Technology**

Did existing alerting systems effectively identify
and alert on the activity?
- How could we have reduced time-to-detection by 50%?
- Do existing alerts need improvement or new alerts
need to be built for this (type of) incident?
- Did existing tools allow for effective
investigation (search/analysis) of the incident?
- What can be done to help identify this (type of)
incident sooner?
- What can be done to help prevent this (type of)
incident from occurring again?
- Who owns the improvement plan and how will you test
that it has been implemented?
- What is the timeline for the additional
monitoring or preventative controls and processes to be
implemented and tested?

This list isn’t all-inclusive, but is intended to serve as a
starting point for identifying what the organization and
business needs are and how you can analyze them in order to most
effectively learn from incidents and continuously improve your
security posture. Most important is getting started by
incorporating lessons learned as a standard part of your
incident response process, documentation, and expectations
across the stakeholders.

## Question SEC11

# SEC 11 — How do you incorporate and validate the security properties of applications?

**Pillar**: Security  
**Best Practices**: 8

---

# SEC11-BP01 Train for application security

Provide training to your team on secure development and operation
practices, which helps them build secure and high-quality software.
This practice helps your team to prevent, detect, and remediate
security issues earlier in the development lifecycle. Consider
training that covers threat modeling, secure coding practices, and
using services for secure configurations and operations. Provide
your team access to training through self-service resources, and
regularly gather their feedback for continuous improvement.

**Desired outcome:** You equip your
team with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and build
software with security in mind from the outset. Through training on
threat modeling and secure development practices, your team has a
deep understanding of potential security risks and how to mitigate
them during the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This
proactive approach to security is part of your team's culture, and
you become able to identify and remediate potential security issues
early on. As a result, your team delivers high-quality, secure
software and features more efficiently, which accelerates the
overall delivery timeline. You have a collaborative and inclusive
security culture within your organization, where the ownership of
security is shared across all builders.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You wait until a security review, and then consider the security
properties of a system.
- You leave all security decisions to a central security team.
- You don't communicate how the decisions taken in the SDLC relate
to the overall security expectations or policies of the
organization.
- You perform the security review process too late.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Better knowledge of the organizational requirements for security
early in the development cycle.
- Being able to identify and remediate potential security issues
faster, resulting in a quicker delivery of features.
- Improved quality of software and systems.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To build secure and high-quality software, provide training to
your team on common practices for secure development and operation
of applications. This practice can help your team prevent, detect,
and remediate security issues earlier in the development
lifecycle, which can accelerate your delivery timeline.

To achieve this practice, consider training your team on threat
modeling using AWS resources like the
[Threat
Modeling Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US). Threat modeling can help your team
understand potential security risks and design systems with
security in mind from the outset. Additionally, you can provide
access to
[AWS Training and Certification](https://www.aws.training/LearningLibrary?filters=Language%3A1%20Domain%3A27), industry, or AWS Partner
training on secure development practices. For more detail on a
comprehensive approach to designing, developing, securing, and
efficiently operating at scale, see
[AWS DevOps Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/devops-guidance/devops-guidance.html).

Clearly define and communicate your organization's security review
process, and outline the responsibilities of your team, the
security team, and other stakeholders. Publish self-service
guidance, code examples, and templates that demonstrate how to
meet your security requirements. You can use AWS services like
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/),
[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) (AWS CDK) Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), and
[Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) to provide pre-approved, secure
configurations and reduce the need for custom setups.

Regularly gather feedback from your team on their experience with
the security review process and training, and use this feedback to
continuously improve. Conduct game days or bug bash campaigns to
identify and address security issues while simultaneously
enhancing your team's skills.

### Implementation steps

- **Identify training needs**:
Assess the current skill level and knowledge gaps within
your team regarding secure development practices through
surveys, code reviews, or discussions with team members.
- **Plan the training**: Based
on the identified needs, create a training plan that covers
relevant topics such as threat modeling, secure coding
practices, security testing, and secure deployment
practices. Employ resources like the
[Threat
Modeling Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US),
[AWS Training and Certification](https://www.aws.training/LearningLibrary?filters=Language%3A1%20Domain%3A27), and industry or AWS
Partner training programs.
- **Schedule and deliver
training**: Schedule regular training sessions or
workshops for your team. These can be instructor-led or
self-paced, depending on your team's preferences and
availability. Encourage hands-on exercises and practical
examples to reinforce the learning.
- **Define a security review
process**: Collaborate with your security team and
other stakeholders to clearly define the security review
process for your applications. Document the responsibilities
of each team or individual involved in the process,
including your development team, security team, and other
relevant stakeholders.
- **Create self-service
resources**: Develop self-service guidance, code
examples, and templates that demonstrate how to meet your
organization's security requirements. Consider AWS services
like
[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/),
[AWS CDK Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), and
[Service
Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) to provide pre-approved, secure
configurations and reduce the need for custom setups.
- **Communicate and
socialize**: Effectively communicate the security
review process and the available self-service resources to
your team. Conduct training sessions or workshops to
familiarize them with these resources, and verify that they
understand how to use them.
- **Gather feedback and
improve**: Regularly collect feedback from your
team on their experience with the security review process
and training. Use this feedback to identify areas for
improvement and continuously refine the training materials,
self-service resources, and the security review process.
- **Conduct security
exercises**: Organize game days or bug bash
campaigns to identify and address security issues within
your applications. These exercises not only help uncover
potential vulnerabilities but also serve as practical
learning opportunities for your team that enhance their
skills in secure development and operation.
- **Continue to learn and
improve:** Encourage your team to stay up to date
with the latest secure development practices, tools, and
techniques. Regularly review and update your training
materials and resources to reflect the evolving security
landscape and best practices.

# SEC11-BP02 Automate testing throughout the development and release lifecycle

Automate the testing for security properties throughout the
development and release lifecycle. Automation makes it easier to
consistently and repeatably identify potential issues in software
prior to release, which reduces the risk of security issues in the
software being provided.

**Desired outcome:** The goal of automated testing is to
provide a programmatic way of detecting potential issues early and often throughout the
development lifecycle. When you automate regression testing, you can rerun functional and
non-functional tests to verify that previously tested software still performs as expected after
a change. When you define security unit tests to check for common misconfigurations, such as
broken or missing authentication, you can identify and fix these issues early in the development
process.

Test automation uses purpose-built test cases for application
validation, based on the application’s requirements and desired
functionality. The result of the automated testing is based on
comparing the generated test output to its respective expected
output, which expedites the overall testing lifecycle. Testing
methodologies such as regression testing and unit test suites are
best suited for automation. Automating the testing of security
properties allows builders to receive automated feedback without
having to wait for a security review. Automated tests in the form
of static or dynamic code analysis can increase code quality and
help detect potential software issues early in the development
lifecycle.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not communicating the test cases and test results of the
automated testing.
- Performing the automated testing only immediately prior to a
release.
- Automating test cases with frequently changing requirements.
- Failing to provide guidance on how to address the results of
security tests.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Reduced dependency on people evaluating the security
properties of systems.
- Having consistent findings across multiple workstreams
improves consistency.
- Reduced likelihood of introducing security issues into
production software.
- Shorter window of time between detection and remediation due
to catching software issues earlier.
- Increased visibility of systemic or repeated behavior across
multiple workstreams, which can be used to drive
organization-wide improvements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**Medium

## Implementation guidance

As you build your software, adopt various mechanisms for software testing to ensure that
you are testing your application for both functional requirements, based on your application’s
business logic, and non-functional requirements, which are focused on application reliability,
performance, and security.

Static application security testing (SAST) analyzes your source code for anomalous security patterns,
and provides indications for defect prone code. SAST relies on static inputs, such as
documentation (requirements specification, design documentation, and design specifications)
and application source code to test for a range of known security issues. Static code
analyzers can help expedite the analysis of large volumes of code.
The [NIST Quality Group](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group)
provides a comparison of [Source Code Security Analyzers](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/source-code-security-analyzers),
which includes open source tools for [Byte Code Scanners](https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Byte_Code_Scanners.html) and [Binary Code Scanners](https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Binary_Code_Scanners.html).

Complement your static testing with dynamic
analysis security testing (DAST) methodologies, which performs
tests against the running application to identify potentially
unexpected behavior. Dynamic testing can be used to detect
potential issues that are not detectable via static analysis.
Testing at the code repository, build, and pipeline stages allows
you to check for different types of potential issues from entering
into your code.
[Amazon Q Developers](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) provides code recommendations, including
security scanning, in the builder's IDE.
[Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) can identify critical issues, security
issues, and hard-to-find bugs during application development, and
provides recommendations to improve code quality. Extracting
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) also allows you to extract a
formal record containing the details and relationships of the
various components used in building your software. This allows you
to inform vulnerability management, and quickly identify software
or component dependencies and supply chain risks.

The
[Security
for Developers workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/sec4devs) uses AWS developer tools, such as
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/),
[AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/), and
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), for release pipeline automation that
includes SAST and DAST testing methodologies.

As you progress through your SDLC, establish an iterative
process that includes periodic application reviews with your
security team. Feedback gathered from these security reviews
should be addressed and validated as part of your release
readiness review. These reviews establish a robust application
security posture, and provide builders with actionable feedback
to address potential issues.

### Implementation steps

- Implement consistent IDE, code review, and CI/CD tools that
include security testing.
- Consider where in the SDLC it is appropriate to block
pipelines instead of just notifying builders that issues
need to be remediated.
- [Automated
Security Helper (ASH)](https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper) is an example for open-source
code security scanning tool.
- Performing testing or code analysis using automated tools,
such as
[Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) integrated with developer IDEs, and
[Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) for scanning code on commit, helps
builders get feedback at the right time.
- When building using AWS Lambda, you can use
[Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/scanning-lambda.html) to scan the application code in your
functions.
- When automated testing is included in CI/CD pipelines, you
should use a ticketing system to track the notification and
remediation of software issues.
- For security tests that might generate findings, linking to
guidance for remediation helps builders improve code
quality.
- Regularly analyze the findings from automated tools to
prioritize the next automation, builder training, or
awareness campaign.
- To extract SBOM as part of your CI/CD pipelines, use
[Amazon Inspector SBOM Generator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html) to produce SBOMs for
archives, container images, directories, local systems, and
compiled Go and Rust binaries in the CycloneDX SBOM format.

# SEC11-BP03 Perform regular penetration testing

Perform regular penetration testing of your software. This
mechanism helps identify potential software issues that cannot be
detected by automated testing or a manual code review. It can also
help you understand the efficacy of your detective controls.
Penetration testing should try to determine if the software can be
made to perform in unexpected ways, such as exposing data that
should be protected, or granting broader permissions than
expected.

**Desired outcome:** Penetration testing is used to detect,
remediate, and validate your application’s security properties. Regular and scheduled
penetration testing should be performed as part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
The findings from penetration tests should be addressed prior to the software being released.
You should analyze the findings from penetration tests to identify if there are issues that
could be found using automation. Having a regular and repeatable penetration testing process
that includes an active feedback mechanism helps inform the guidance to builders and improves
software quality.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Only penetration testing for known or prevalent security
issues.
- Penetration testing applications without dependent third-party
tools and libraries.
- Only penetration testing for package security issues, and not
evaluating implemented business logic.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Increased confidence in the security properties of the
software prior to release.
- Opportunity to identify preferred application patterns, which
leads to greater software quality.
- A feedback loop that identifies earlier in the development
cycle where automation or additional training can improve the
security properties of software.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**High

## Implementation guidance

Penetration testing is a structured security testing exercise
where you run planned security breach scenarios to detect,
remediate, and validate security controls. Penetration tests start
with reconnaissance, during which data is gathered based on the
current design of the application and its dependencies. A curated
list of security-specific testing scenarios are built and run. The
key purpose of these tests is to uncover security issues in your
application, which could be exploited for gaining unintended
access to your environment, or unauthorized access to data. You
should perform penetration testing when you launch new features,
or whenever your application has undergone major changes in
function or technical implementation.

You should identify the most appropriate stage in the development
lifecycle to perform penetration testing. This testing should
happen late enough that the functionality of the system is close
to the intended release state, but with enough time remaining for
any issues to be remediated.

### Implementation steps

- Have a structured process for how penetration testing is
scoped, basing this process on the
[threat
model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-approach-threat-modeling/) is a good way of maintaining context.
- Identify the appropriate place in the development cycle to
perform penetration testing. This should be when there is
minimal change expected in the application, but with enough
time to perform remediation.
- Train your builders on what to expect from penetration
testing findings, and how to get information on remediation.
- Use tools to speed up the penetration testing process by
automating common or repeatable tests.
- Analyze penetration testing findings to identify systemic
security issues, and use this data to inform additional
automated testing and ongoing builder education.

# SEC11-BP04 Conduct code reviews

Implement code reviews to help verify the quality and security of
software being developed. Code reviews involve having team members
other than the original code author review the code for potential
issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards and best
practices. This process helps catch errors, inconsistencies, and
security flaws that might have been overlooked by the original
developer. Use automated tools to assist with code reviews.

**Desired outcome:** You include code
reviews during development to increase the quality of the software
being written. You upskill less experienced members of the team
through learnings identified during the code review. You identify
opportunities for automation and support the code review process
using automated tools and testing.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You don't review code before deployment.
- The same person writes and reviews the code.
- You don't use automation and tools to assist or orchestrate code
reviews.
- You don't train builders on application security before they
review code.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Increased code quality.
- Increased consistency of code development through reuse of
common approaches.
- Reduction in the number of issues discovered during
penetration testing and later stages.
- Improved knowledge transfer within the team.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

Code reviews help to verify the quality and security of the
software during development. Manual reviews involve having a team
member other than the original code author review the code for
potential issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding
standards and best practices. This process helps catch errors,
inconsistencies, and security flaws that might have been
overlooked by the original developer.

Consider [Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html)
to help conduct automated code reviews. CodeGuru Security uses
machine learning and automated reasoning to analyze your code and
identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding issues.
Integrate automated code reviews with your existing code
repositories and continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines.

### Implementation steps

- **Establish a code review
process:**

Define when code reviews should occur, such as before
merging code into the main branch or before deploying to
production.
- Determine who should be involved in the code review
process, such as team members, senior developers, and
security experts.
- Decide on the code review methodology, including the
process and tools to be used.

- **Set up code review tools:**

team's needs, such as GitHub Pull Requests or CodeGuru
Security
- Integrate the chosen tools with your existing code
repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
- Configure the tools to enforce code review requirements,
such as the minimum number of reviewers and approval
rules.

- **Define a code review checklist and
guidelines:**

Create a code review checklist or guidelines that
outline what should be reviewed. Consider factors such
as code quality, security vulnerabilities, adherence to
coding standards, and performance.
- Share the checklist or guidelines with the development
team, and verify everyone understands the expectations.

- **Train developers on code review best
practices:**

Provide training to your team on how to conduct
effective code reviews.
- Educate your team on application security principles and
common vulnerabilities to look for during reviews.
- Encourage knowledge sharing and pair programming
sessions to upskill less experienced team members.

- **Implement the code review
process:**

Integrate the code review step into your development
workflow, such as creating a pull request and assigning
reviewers.
- Require that code changes undergo a code review before
merge or deployment.
- Encourage open communication and constructive feedback
during the review process.

- **Monitor and improve:**

Regularly review the effectiveness of your code review
process and gather feedback from the team.
- Identify opportunities for automation or tool
improvements to streamline the code review process.
- Continuously update and refine the code review checklist
or guidelines based on learnings and industry best
practices.

# SEC11-BP05 Centralize services for packages and dependencies

Provide centralized services for your teams to obtain software
packages and other dependencies. This allows the validation of
packages before they are included in the software that you write and
provides a source of data for the analysis of the software being
used in your organization.

**Desired outcome:** You build your
workload from external software packages in addition to the code
that you write. This makes it simpler for you to implement
functionality that is repeatedly used, such as a JSON parser or an
encryption library. You centralize the sources for these packages
and dependencies so your security team can validate them before they
are used. You use this approach in conjunction with the manual and
automated testing flows to increase the confidence in the quality of
the software that you develop.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You pull packages from arbitrary repositories on the internet.
- You don't test new packages before you make them available to
builders.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Better understanding of what packages are being used in the
software being built.
- Being able to notify workload teams when a package needs to be
updated based on the understanding of who is using what.
- Reducing the risk of a package with issues being included in
your software.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**Medium

## Implementation guidance

Provide centralized services for packages and dependencies in a
way that is simple for builders to consume. Centralized services
can be logically central rather than implemented as a monolithic
system. This approach allows you to provide services in a way that
meets the needs of your builders. You should implement an
efficient way of adding packages to the repository when updates
happen or new requirements emerge. AWS services such as
[AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/) or similar AWS partner solutions provide a way
of delivering this capability.

### Implementation steps

- Implement a logically centralized repository service that
is available in all of the environments where software is
developed.
- Include access to the repository as part of the AWS account
vending process.
- Build automation to test packages before they are published
in a repository.
- Maintain metrics of the most commonly used packages,
languages, and teams with the highest amount of change.
- Provide an automated mechanism for builder teams to request
new packages and provide feedback.
- Regularly scan packages in your repository to identify the
potential impact of newly discovered issues.

# SEC11-BP06 Deploy software programmatically

Perform software deployments programmatically where possible.
This approach reduces the likelihood that a deployment fails or an
unexpected issue is introduced due to human error.

**Desired outcome:** The version of
your workload that you test is the version that you deploy, and the
deployment is performed consistently every time. You externalize the
configuration of your workload, which helps you deploy to different
environments without changes. You employ cryptographic signing of
your software packages to verify that nothing changes between
environments.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Manually deploying software into production.
- Manually performing changes to software to cater to different
environments.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Increased confidence in the software release process.
- Reduced risk of a failed change impacting business
functionality.
- Increased release cadence due to lower change risk.
- Automatic rollback capability for unexpected events during
deployment.
- Ability to cryptographically prove that the software that was
tested is the software deployed.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

To maintain a robust and reliable application infrastructure,
implement secure and automated deployment practices. This practice
involves removing persistent human access from production
environments, using CI/CD tools for deployments, and externalizing
environment-specific configuration data. By following this
approach, you can enhance security, reduce the risk of human
errors, and streamline the deployment process.

You can build your AWS account structure to remove persistent
human access from production environments. This practice minimizes
the risk of unauthorized changes or accidental modifications,
which improves the integrity of your production systems. Instead
of direct human access, you can use CI/CD tools like
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) to perform deployments. You can use these
services to automate the build, test, and deployment processes,
which reduces manual intervention and increases consistency.

To further enhance security and traceability, you can sign your
application packages after they have been tested and validate
these signatures during deployment. To do so, use cryptographic
tools such as
[AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) or
[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). By signing and verifying packages, you
can make sure that you deploy only authorized and validated code
to your environments.

Additionally, your team can architect your workload to obtain
environment-specific configuration data from an external source,
such as
[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html). This practice separates
the application code from the configuration data, which helps you
manage and update configurations independently without modifying
the application code itself.

To streamline infrastructure provisioning and management, consider
using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) or
[AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). You
can use these tools to define your infrastructure as code, which
improves the consistency and repeatability of deployments across
different environments.

Consider canary deployments to validate the successful deployment
of your software. Canary deployments involve rolling out changes
to a subset of instances or users before deploying to the entire
production environment. You can then monitor the impact of changes
and roll back if necessary, which minimizes the risk of widespread
issues.

Follow the recommendations outlined in the
[Organizing
Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html) whitepaper.
This whitepaper provides guidance on separating environments (such
as development, staging, and production) into distinct AWS accounts, which further enhances security and isolation.

### Implementation steps

- **Set up AWS account
structure**:

Follow the guidance in the
[Organizing
Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html)
whitepaper to create separate AWS accounts for different
environments (for exampoe, development, staging, and
production).
- Configure appropriate access controls and permissions
for each account to restrict direct human access to
production environments.

- **Implement a CI/CD
pipeline**:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using services like
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).
- Configure the pipeline to automatically build, test, and
deploy your application code to the respective
environments.
- Integrate code repositories with the CI/CD pipeline for
version control and code management.

- **Sign and verify application
packages**:

Use
[AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) or
[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to sign your
application packages after they have been tested and
validated.
- Configure the deployment process to verify the
signatures of the application packages before you deploy
them to the target environments.

- **Externalize configuration
data**:

Store environment-specific configuration data in
[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html).
- Modify your application code to retrieve configuration
data from the Parameter Store during deployment or
runtime.

- **Implement infrastructure as code
(IaC)**:

Use IaC tools like
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) or
[AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to define and manage your infrastructure as
code.
- Create CloudFormation templates or CDK scripts to
provision and configure the necessary AWS resources for
your application.
- Integrate IaC with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically
deploy infrastructure changes alongside application code
changes.

- **Implement canary
deployments**:

Configure your deployment process to support canary
deployments, where changes are rolled out to a subset of
instances or users before you deploy them to the entire
production environment.
- Use services like
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) or
[AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) to manage canary deployments and monitor the
impact of changes.
- Implement rollback mechanisms to revert to the previous
stable version if issues are detected during the canary
deployment.

- **Monitor and audit**:

Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms to track
deployments, application performance, and infrastructure
changes.
- Use services like
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and
[AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) to collect and analyze logs and
metrics.
- Implement auditing and compliance checks to verify
adherence to security best practices and regulatory
requirements.

- **Continuously improve:**

Regularly review and update your deployment practices,
and incorporate feedback and lessons learned from
previous deployments.
- Automate as much of the deployment process as possible
to reduce manual intervention and potential human
errors.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams (for example,
operations or security) to align and continuously
improve deployment practices.

By following these steps, you can implement secure and automated
deployment practices in your AWS environment, which enhances
security, reduces the risk of human errors, and streamlines the
deployment process.

# SEC11-BP07 Regularly assess security properties of the pipelines

Apply the principles of the Well-Architected Security Pillar to
your pipelines, with particular attention to the separation of
permissions. Regularly assess the security properties of your
pipeline infrastructure. Effectively managing the security
*of* the pipelines allows you to deliver the
security of the software that passes *through*
the pipelines.

**Desired outcome:** The pipelines
you use to build and deploy your software follow the same
recommended practices as any other workload in your environment. The
tests that you implement in your pipelines are not editable by the
teams who use them. You give the pipelines only the permissions
needed for the deployments they are doing using temporary
credentials. You implement safeguards to prevent pipelines from
deploying to the wrong environments. You configure your pipelines to
emit state so that the integrity of your build environments can be
validated.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Security tests that can be bypassed by builders.
- Overly broad permissions for deployment pipelines.
- Pipelines not being configured to validate inputs.
- Not regularly reviewing the permissions associated with your
CI/CD infrastructure.
- Use of long-term or hardcoded credentials.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Greater confidence in the integrity of the software that is
built and deployed through the pipelines.
- Ability to stop a deployment when there is suspicious
activity.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Your deployment pipelines are a critical component of your
software development lifecycle and should follow the same security
principles and practices as any other workload in your
environment. This includes implementing proper access controls,
validating inputs, and regularly reviewing and auditing the
permissions associated with your CI/CD infrastructure.

Verify that the teams responsible for building and deploying
applications do not have the ability to edit or bypass the
security tests and checks implemented in your pipelines. This
separation of concerns helps maintain the integrity of your build
and deployment processes.

As a starting point, consider employing the
[AWS Deployment Pipelines Reference Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new_deployment_pipelines_reference_architecture_and_-reference_implementations/). This reference
architecture provides a secure and scalable foundation for
building your CI/CD pipelines on AWS.

Additionally, you can use services like
[AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) to generate least-privilege IAM
policies for both your pipeline permissions and as a step in your
pipeline to verify workload permissions. This helps verify that
your pipelines and workloads have only the necessary permissions
required for their specific functions, which reduces the risk of
unauthorized access or actions.

### Implementation steps

- Start with the
[AWS Deployment Pipelines Reference Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new_deployment_pipelines_reference_architecture_and_-reference_implementations/).
- Consider using
[AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) to programmatically generate
least privilege IAM policies for the pipelines.
- Integrate your pipelines with monitoring and alerting so
that you are notified of unexpected or abnormal activity,
for AWS managed services
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) allows you to route data to targets such
as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or
[Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) (Amazon SNS).

# SEC11-BP08 Build a program that embeds security ownership in workload teams

Build a program or mechanism that empowers builder teams to
make security decisions about the software that they create. Your
security team still needs to validate these decisions during a
review, but embedding security ownership in builder teams allows for
faster, more secure workloads to be built. This mechanism also
promotes a culture of ownership that positively impacts the
operation of the systems you build.

**Desired outcome:** You have
embedded security ownership and decision-making in your teams. You
have either trained your teams on how to think about security or
have augmented their team with embedded or associated security
people. Your teams make higher-quality security decisions earlier in
the development cycle as a result.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Leaving all security design decisions to a security team.
- Not addressing security requirements early enough in the
development process.
- Not obtaining feedback from builders and security people on
the operation of the program.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Reduced time to complete security reviews.
- Reduction in security issues that are only detected at the
security review stage.
- Improvement in the overall quality of the software being
written.
- Opportunity to identify and understand systemic issues or
areas of high value improvement.
- Reduction in the amount of rework required due to security
review findings.
- Improvement in the perception of the security function.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Low

## Implementation guidance

Start with the guidance in [SEC11-BP01 Train for application security](./sec_appsec_train_for_application_security.html).
Then identify the operational model for the program that
you think might work best for your organization. The two main
patterns are to train builders or to embed security people in
builder teams. After you have decided on the initial approach, you
should pilot with a single or small group of workload teams to
prove the model works for your organization. Leadership support
from the builder and security parts of the organization helps with
the delivery and success of the program. As you build this
program, it’s important to choose metrics that can be used to show
the value of the program. Learning from how AWS has approached
this problem is a good learning experience. This best practice is
very much focused on organizational change and culture. The tools
that you use should support the collaboration between the builder
and security communities.

### Implementation steps

- Start by training your builders for application security.
- Create a community and an onboarding program to educate
builders.
- Pick a name for the program. Guardians, Champions, or
Advocates are commonly used.
- Identify the model to use: train builders, embed security
engineers, or have affinity security roles.
- Identify project sponsors from security, builders, and
potentially other relevant groups.
- Track metrics for the number of people involved in the
program, the time taken for reviews, and the feedback from
builders and security people. Use these metrics to make
improvements.
