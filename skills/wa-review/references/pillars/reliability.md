# REL01-BP01 Aware of service quotas and constraints

Be aware of your default quotas and manage your quota increase requests for your workload architecture.
Know which cloud resource constraints, such as disk or network, are potentially impactful.

**Desired outcome:**
Customers can prevent service degradation or disruption in their AWS accounts by
implementing proper guidelines for monitoring key metrics, infrastructure reviews,
and automation remediation steps to verify that services quotas and constraints are
not reached that could cause service degradation or disruption.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying a workload without understanding the hard or soft quotas and their limits for the services used.
- Deploying a replacement workload without analyzing and reconfiguring the necessary quotas or contacting Support in advance.
- Assuming that cloud services have no limits and the services can be used without consideration to rates, limits, counts, quantities.
- Assuming that quotas will automatically be increased.
- Not knowing the process and timeline of quota requests.
- Assuming that the default cloud service quota is the identical for every service compared across regions.
- Assuming that service constraints can be breached and the systems will auto-scale or add increase the limit beyond the resource’s constraints
- Not testing the application at peak traffic in order to stress the utilization of its resources.
- Provisioning the resource without analysis of the required resource size.
- Overprovisioning capacity by choosing resource types that go well beyond actual need or expected peaks.
- Not assessing capacity requirements for new levels of traffic in advance of a new customer event or deploying a new technology.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Monitoring and automated management of service quotas and resource constraints
can proactively reduce failures. Changes in traffic patterns for a customer’s service can cause a
disruption or degradation if best practices are not followed. By monitoring and managing these values
across all regions and all accounts, applications can have improved resiliency under adverse or
unplanned events.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Service Quotas is an AWS service that helps you manage your quotas for over
250 AWS services from one location. Along with looking up the quota values,
you can also request and track quota increases from the Service Quotas console
or using the AWS SDK. AWS Trusted Advisor offers a service quotas check that
displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. The default
service quotas per service are also in the AWS documentation per respective
service (for example, see [Amazon VPC Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html)).

Some service limits, like rate limits on throttled APIs are set within the
Amazon API Gateway itself by configuring a usage plan. Some limits that are set as
configuration on their respective services include Provisioned IOPS, Amazon RDS
storage allocated, and Amazon EBS volume allocations.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud has its own service limits dashboard
that can help you manage your instance, Amazon Elastic Block Store,
and Elastic IP address limits. If you have a use case where service quotas
impact your application’s performance and they are not adjustable to your
needs, then contact Support to see if there are mitigations.

Service quotas can be Region specific or can also be global in nature.
Using an AWS service that reaches its quota will not act as expected in
normal usage and may cause service disruption or degradation. For example,
a service quota limits the number of DL Amazon EC2 instances used in a Region. That limit may be reached during a traffic scaling event using Auto Scaling groups (ASG).

Service quotas for each account should be assessed for usage on a regular
basis to determine what the appropriate service limits might be for that
account. These service quotas exist as operational guardrails, to prevent
accidentally provisioning more resources than you need. They also serve
to limit request rates on API operations to protect services from abuse.

Service constraints are different from service quotas. Service constraints
represent a particular resource’s limits as defined by that resource type.
These might be storage capacity (for example, gp2 has a size limit of 1 GB - 16 TB)
or disk throughput. It is essential that a resource type’s
constraint be engineered and constantly assessed for usage that might reach
its limit. If a constraint is reached unexpectedly, the account’s applications
or services may be degraded or disrupted.

If there is a use case where service quotas impact an application’s performance
and they cannot be adjusted to required needs, contact Support to see if
there are mitigations. For more detail on adjusting fixed quotas, see
[REL01-BP03 Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints through architecture](./rel_manage_service_limits_aware_fixed_limits.html).

There are a number of AWS services and tools to help monitor and manage Service Quotas.
The service and tools should be leveraged to provide automated or manual checks of quota levels.

- AWS Trusted Advisor offers a service quota check that displays your usage and quotas
for some aspects of some services. It can aid in identifying services that are near quota.
- AWS Management Console provides methods to display services quota values, manage,
request new quotas, monitor status of quota requests, and display history of quotas.
- AWS CLI and CDKs offer programmatic methods to automatically manage and monitor service quota levels and usage.

**Implementation steps**

For Service Quotas:

- [Review AWS Service Quotas.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)
- To be aware of your existing service quotas, determine the services (like IAM Access Analyzer) that are used.
There are approximately 250 AWS services controlled by service quotas. Then, determine the specific service
quota name that might be used within each account and Region. There are approximately 3000 service quota names per Region.
- Augment this quota analysis with AWS Config to find all
[AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html) used in your AWS accounts.
- Use [AWS CloudFormation data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.html) to determine your AWS resources used.
Look at the resources that were created either in the
AWS Management Console or with the [list-stack-resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-resources.html) AWS CLI command.
You can also see resources configured to be deployed in the template itself.
- Determine all the services your workload requires by looking at the deployment code.
- Determine the service quotas that apply. Use the programmatically accessible information from Trusted Advisor and Service Quotas.
- Establish an automated monitoring method
(see [REL01-BP02 Manage service quotas across accounts and regions](./rel_manage_service_limits_limits_considered.html)
and [REL01-BP04 Monitor and manage quotas](./rel_manage_service_limits_monitor_manage_limits.html))
to alert and inform if services quotas are near or have reached their limit.
- Establish an automated and programmatic method to check if a service quota has
been changed in one region but not in other regions in the same account
(see [REL01-BP02 Manage service quotas across accounts and regions](./rel_manage_service_limits_limits_considered.html)
and [REL01-BP04 Monitor and manage quotas](./rel_manage_service_limits_monitor_manage_limits.html)).
- Automate scanning application logs and metrics to determine if there
are any quota or service constraint errors. If these errors are present,
send alerts to the monitoring system.
- Establish engineering procedures to calculate the required change in quota
(see [REL01-BP05 Automate quota management](./rel_manage_service_limits_automated_monitor_limits.html))
once it has been identified that larger quotas are required for specific services.
- Create a provisioning and approval workflow to request changes in service quota.
This should include an exception workflow in case of request deny or partial approval.
- Create an engineering method to review service quotas prior to
provisioning and using new AWS services before rolling out to
production or loaded environments. (for example, load testing account).

For service constraints:

- Establish monitoring and metrics methods to alert for resources reading close
to their resource constraints. Leverage CloudWatch as appropriate for metrics
or log monitoring.
- Establish alert thresholds for each resource that has a constraint that is
meaningful to the application or system.
- Create workflow and infrastructure management procedures to change the
resource type if the constraint is near utilization. This workflow should
include load testing as a best practice to verify that new type is the
correct resource type with the new constraints.
- Migrate identified resource to the recommended new resource type, using
existing procedures and processes.

# REL01-BP02 Manage service quotas across accounts and regions

If you are using multiple accounts or Regions,
request the appropriate quotas in all environments
in which your production workloads run.

**Desired outcome:** Services and applications
should not be affected by service quota exhaustion for configurations that
span accounts or Regions or that have resilience designs using zone, Region,
or account failover.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Allowing resource usage in one isolation Region
to grow with no mechanism to maintain capacity in the
other ones.
- Manually setting all quotas independently in isolation Regions.
- Not considering the effect of resiliency architectures
(like active or passive) in future quota needs during a
degradation in the non-primary Region.
- Not evaluating quotas regularly and making necessary
changes in every Region and account the workload runs.
- Not leveraging [quota request templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/organization-templates.html)
to request increases across multiple Regions and accounts.
- Not updating service quotas due to incorrectly
thinking that increasing quotas has cost implications
like compute reservation requests.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Verifying that you can handle your
current load in secondary regions or accounts if regional
services become unavailable. This can help reduce the number
of errors or levels of degradations that occur during region
loss.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Service quotas are tracked per account. Unless otherwise
noted, each quota is AWS Region-specific. In addition to
the production environments, also manage quotas in all
applicable non-production environments so that testing
and development are not hindered. Maintaining a high
degree of resiliency requires that service quotas are
assessed continually (whether automated or manual).

With more workloads spanning Regions due to the implementation
of designs using *Active/Active*,
*Active/Passive – Hot*,
*Active/Passive-Cold*, and
*Active/Passive-Pilot Light* approaches,
it is essential to understand all Region and account quota levels.
Past traffic patterns are not always a good indicator if the
service quota is set correctly.

Equally important, the service quota name limit is not always
the same for every Region. In one Region, the value could be
five, and in another region the value could be ten. Management
of these quotas must span all the same services, accounts, and
Regions to provide consistent resilience under load.

Reconcile all the service quota differences across different
Regions (Active Region or Passive Region) and create processes
to continually reconcile these differences. The testing plans
of passive Region failovers are rarely scaled to peak active
capacity, meaning that game day or table top exercises can
fail to find differences in service quotas between Regions
and also then maintain the correct limits.

*Service quota drift*, the condition where service quota limits
for a specific named quota is changed in one Region and not
all Regions, is very important to track and assess. Changing
the quota in Regions with traffic or potentially could carry
traffic should be considered.

- Select relevant accounts and Regions based on your service requirements, latency,
regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements.
- Identify service quotas across all relevant accounts, Regions, and
Availability Zones. The limits are scoped to account and Region. These
values should be compared for differences.

**Implementation steps**

- Review Service Quotas values that might have
breached beyond the a risk level of usage.
AWS Trusted Advisor provides alerts for 80% and 90%
threshold breaches.
- Review values for service quotas in any Passive
Regions (in an Active/Passive design). Verify
that load will successfully run in secondary
Regions in the event of a failure in the primary
Region.
- Automate assessing if any service quota drift has
occurred between Regions in the same account and
act accordingly to change the limits.
- If the customer Organizational Units (OU) are structured
in the supported manner, service quota templates should
be updated to reflect changes in any quotas that should
be applied to multiple Regions and accounts.

Create a template and associate Regions to the quota change.
- Review all existing service quota templates for any changes
required (Region, limits, and accounts).

# REL01-BP03 Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints through architecture

Be aware of unchangeable service quotas, service constraints, and physical resource limits. Design architectures for applications and services to prevent these limits from impacting reliability.

Examples include network bandwidth, serverless function invocation payload size, throttle burst rate for of an API gateway, and concurrent user connections to a database.

**Desired outcome:** The application or service performs as expected under normal and high traffic conditions. They have been designed to work within the limitations for that resource’s fixed constraints or service quotas.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Choosing a design that uses a resource of a service, unaware that there are design constraints that will cause this design to fail as you scale.
- Performing benchmarking that is unrealistic and will reach service fixed quotas during the testing. For example, running tests at a burst limit but for an extended amount of time.
- Choosing a design that cannot scale or be modified if fixed service quotas are to be exceeded. For example, an SQS payload size of 256KB.
- Observability has not been designed and implemented to monitor and alert on thresholds for service quotas that might be at risk during high traffic events

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Verifying that the application will run under all projected services load levels without disruption or degradation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Unlike soft service quotas or resources that be replaced with higher capacity units, AWS services’ fixed quotas cannot be changed. This means that all these type of AWS services must be evaluated for potential hard capacity limits when used in an application design.

Hard limits are shown in the Service Quotas console. If the columns shows `ADJUSTABLE = No`, the service has a hard limit. Hard limits are also shown in some resources configuration pages. For example, Lambda has specific hard limits that cannot be adjusted.

As an example, when designing a python application to run in a Lambda function, the application should be evaluated to determine if there is any chance of Lambda running longer than 15 minutes. If the code may run more than this service quota limit, alternate technologies or designs must be considered. If this limit is reached after production deployment, the application will suffer degradation and disruption until it can be remediated. Unlike soft quotas, there is no method to change to these limits even under emergency Severity 1 events.

Once the application has been deployed to a testing environment, strategies should be used to find if any hard limits can be reached. Stress testing, load testing, and chaos testing should be part of the introduction test plan.

**Implementation steps**

- Review the complete list of AWS services that could be used in the application design phase.
- Review the soft quota limits and hard quota limits for all these services. Not all limits are shown in the Service Quotas console. Some services [describe these limits in alternate locations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html).
- As you design your application, review your workload’s business and technology drivers, such as business outcomes, use case, dependent systems, availability targets, and disaster recovery objects. Let your business and technology drivers guide the process to identify the distributed system that is right for your workload.
- Analyze service load across Regions and accounts. Many hard limits are regionally based for services. However, some limits are account based.
- Analyze resilience architectures for resource usage during a zonal failure and Regional failure. In the progression of multi-Region designs using active/active, active/passive – hot, active/passive - cold, and active/passive - pilot light approaches, these failure cases will cause higher usage. This creates a potential use case for hitting hard limits.

# REL01-BP04 Monitor and manage quotas

Evaluate your potential usage and increase your quotas
appropriately, allowing for planned growth in usage.

**Desired outcome:** Active and automated systems that manage and monitor have been deployed. These operations solutions ensure that quota usage thresholds are nearing being reached. These would be proactively remediated by requested quota changes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not configuring monitoring to check for service quota thresholds
- Not configuring monitoring for hard limits, even though those values cannot be changed.
- Assuming that amount of time required to request and secure a soft quota change is immediate or a short period.
- Configuring alarms for when service quotas are being approached, but having no process on how to respond to an alert.
- Only configuring alarms for services supported by AWS Service Quotas and not monitoring other AWS services.
- Not considering quota management for multiple Region resiliency designs, like active/active, active/passive – hot, active/passive - cold, and active/passive - pilot light approaches.
- Not assessing quota differences between Regions.
- Not assessing the needs in every Region for a specific quota increase request.
- Not leveraging [templates for multi-Region quota management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/organization-templates.html).

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automatic tracking of the AWS Service Quotas
and monitoring your usage against those quotas will allow you to see
when you are approaching a quota limit. You can also use this
monitoring data to help limit any degradations due to quota exhaustion.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

For supported services, you can monitor your quotas by configuring various different services that can assess and then send alerts or alarms. This can aid in monitoring usage and can alert you to approaching quotas. These alarms can be invoked from AWS Config, Lambda functions, Amazon CloudWatch, or from AWS Trusted Advisor. You can also use metric filters on CloudWatch Logs to search and extract patterns in logs to determine if usage is approaching quota thresholds.

**Implementation steps**

For monitoring:

- Capture current resource consumption (for example, buckets or instances). Use service API operations, such as the Amazon EC2 `DescribeInstances` API, to collect current resource consumption.
- Capture your current quotas that are essential and applicable to the services using:

AWS Service Quotas
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- AWS documentation
- AWS service-specific pages
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
- AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

- Use AWS Service Quotas, an AWS service that helps you manage your quotas for over 250 AWS services from one location.
- Use Trusted Advisor service limits to monitor your current service limits at various thresholds.
- Use the service quota history (console or AWS CLI) to check on regional increases.
- Compare service quota changes in each Region and each account to create equivalency, if required.

For management:

- Automated: Set up an AWS Config custom rule to scan service quotas across Regions and compare for differences.
- Automated: Set up a scheduled Lambda function to scan service quotas across Regions and compare for differences.
- Manual: Scan services quota through AWS CLI, API, or AWS Console to scan service quotas across Regions and compare for differences. Report the differences.
- If differences in quotas are identified between Regions, request a quota change, if required.
- Review the result of all requests.

# REL01-BP05 Automate quota management

Service quotas, also referred to as limits in AWS services, are the
maximum values for the resources in your AWS account. Each AWS
service defines a set of quotas and their default values. To provide
your workload access to all the resources it needs, you might need
to increase your service quota values.

Growth in workload consumption of AWS resources can threaten
workload stability and impact the user experience if quotas are
exceeded. Implement tools to alert you when your workload approaches
the limits and consider creating quota increase requests
automatically.

**Desired outcome:** Quotas are
appropriately configured for the workloads running in each AWS account and Region.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You fail to consider and adjust quotas appropriately to meet
workload requirements.
- You track quotas and usage using methods that can become
outdated, such as with spreadsheets.
- You only update service limits on periodic schedules.
- Your organization lacks operational processes to review existing
quotas and request service quota increases when necessary.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Enhanced workload resiliency: You prevent errors caused by
exceeding AWS resource quotas.
- Simplified disaster recovery: You can reuse automated quota
management mechanisms built in the primary Region during DR
setup in another AWS Region.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

View current quotas and track ongoing quota consumption through
mechanisms such as AWS Service Quotas console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs. You can also integrate your
configuration management databases (CMDB) and IT service
management (ITSM) systems with the AWS Service Quota APIs.

Generate automated alerts if quota usage reaches your defined
thresholds, and define a process for submitting quota increase
requests when you receive alerts. If the underlying workload is
critical to your business, you can automate quota increase
requests, but carefully test the automation to avoid the risk of
runaway action such as a growth feedback loop.

Smaller quota increases are often automatically approved. Larger
quota requests may need to be manually processed by AWS support
and can take additional time to review and process. Allow for
additional time to process multiple requests or large increase
requests.

### Implementation steps

- Implement automated monitoring of service quotas, and issue
alerts if your workload's resource utilization growth
approaches your quota limits. For example,
[Quota
Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/quota-monitor-for-aws/solution-overview.html) for AWS can provide automated monitoring of
service quotas. This tool integrates with AWS Organizations
and deploys using Cloudformation StackSets so that new
accounts are automatically monitored on creation.
- Use features such as
[Service Quotas request templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/organization-templates.html) or
[AWS Control Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WUShZ4lZGE) to simplify Service Quotas setup for
new accounts.
- Build dashboards of your current service quota use across
all AWS accounts and regions and reference them as necessary
to prevent exceeding your quotas.
[Trusted
Advisor Organizational (TAO) Dashboard](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/a-detailed-overview-of-trusted-advisor-organizational-dashboard/), part of the
[Cloud
Intelligence Dashboards](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscid/en-US), can get you quickly started
with such a dashboard.
- Track service limit increase requests.
[Consolidated
Insights from Multiple Accounts(CIMA)](https://github.com/aws-samples/case-insights-for-multi-accounts) can provide an
Organization-level view of all your requests.
- Test alert generation and any quota increase request
automation by setting lower quota thresholds in
non-production accounts. Do not conduct these tests in a
production account.

# REL01-BP06 Ensure that a sufficient gap exists between the current quotas and the maximum usage to accommodate failover

This article explains how to maintain space between the resource quota and your usage, and how it can benefit your organization. After you finish using a resource, the usage quota may continue to account for that resource. This can result in a failing or inaccessible resource. Prevent resource failure by verifying that your quotas cover the overlap of inaccessible resources and their replacements. Consider cases like network failure, Availability Zone failure, or Region failures when calculating this gap.

**Desired outcome:** Small or large failures in resources or resource accessibility can be covered within the current service thresholds. Zone failures, network failures, or even Regional failures have been considered in the resource planning.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Setting service quotas based on current needs without accounting for failover scenarios.
- Not considering the principals of static stability when calculating the peak quota for a service.
- Not considering the potential of inaccessible resources in calculating total quota needed for each Region.
- Not considering AWS service fault isolation boundaries for some services and their potential abnormal usage patterns.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When service disruption events impact application availability, use the cloud to implement strategies to recover from these events. An example strategy is creating additional resources to replace inaccessible resources to accommodate failover conditions without exhausting your service limit.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

When evaluating a quota limit, consider failover cases that might occur due to some degradation. Consider the following failover cases.

- A disrupted or inaccessible VPC.
- An inaccessible subnet.
- A degraded Availability Zone that impacts resource accessibility.
- Networking routes or ingress and egress points are blocked or changed.
- A degraded Region that impacts resource accessibility.
- A subset of resources affected by a failure in a Region or an Availability Zone.

The decision to failover is unique for each situation, as the business impact can vary. Address resource capacity planning in the failover location and the resources’ quotas before deciding to failover an application or service.

Consider higher than normal peaks of activity when reviewing quotas for each service. These peaks might be related to resources that are inaccessible due to networking or permissions, but are still active. Unterminated active resources count against the service quota limit.

**Implementation steps**

- Maintain space between your service quota and your maximum usage to accommodate for a failover or loss of accessibility.
- Determine your service quotas. Account for typical deployment patterns, availability requirements, and consumption growth.
- Request quota increases if necessary. Anticipate a wait time for the quota increase request.
- Determine your reliability requirements (also known as your number of nines).
- Understand potential fault scenarios such as loss of a component, an Availability Zone, or a Region.
- Establish your deployment methodology (examples include canary, blue/green, red/black, and rolling).
- Include an appropriate buffer to the current quota limit. An example buffer could be 15%.
- Include calculations for static stability (Zonal and Regional) where appropriate.
- Plan consumption growth and monitor your consumption trends.
- Consider the static stability impact for your most critical workloads. Assess resources
conforming to a statically stable system in all Regions and Availability Zones.
- Consider using On-Demand Capacity Reservations to schedule capacity ahead of any failover. This is a useful strategy to implement for critical business schedules to reduce potential risks of obtaining the correct quantity and type of resources during failover.

## Question REL02

# REL 2 — How do you plan your network topology?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 5

# REL02-BP01 Use highly available network connectivity for your workload public endpoints

Building highly available network connectivity to public endpoints of your workloads can help you reduce downtime due to loss of connectivity and improve the availability and SLA of your workload. To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API gateways, load balancing, or reverse proxies.

**Desired outcome:** It is critical to plan, build, and operationalize highly available network connectivity for your public endpoints. If your workload becomes unreachable due to a loss in connectivity, even if your workload is running and available, your customers will see your system as down. By combining the highly available and resilient network connectivity for your workload’s public endpoints, along with a resilient architecture for your workload itself, you can provide the best possible availability and service level for your customers.

AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda Function URLs, AWS AppSync APIs, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. Amazon Route 53 provides a highly available DNS service for domain name resolution to verify that your public endpoint addresses can be resolved.

You can also evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Designing a highly available workload without planning out DNS and network connectivity for high availability.
- Using public internet addresses on individual instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them with DNS.
- Using IP addresses instead of domain names for locating services.
- Not testing out scenarios where connectivity to your public endpoints is lost.
- Not analyzing network throughput needs and distribution patterns.
- Not testing and planning for scenarios where internet network connectivity to your public endpoints of your workload might be interrupted.
- Providing content (like web pages, static assets, or media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.
- Not planning for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Designing for highly available and resilient network connectivity ensures that your workload is accessible and available to your users.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

At the core of building highly available network connectivity to your public endpoints is the routing of the traffic. To verify your traffic is able to reach the endpoints, the DNS must be able to resolve the domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. Use a highly available and scalable [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/) such as Amazon Route 53 to manage your domain’s DNS records. You can also use health checks provided by Amazon Route 53. The health checks verify that your application is reachable, available, and functional, and they can be set up in a way that they mimic your user’s behavior, such as requesting a web page or a specific URL. In case of failure, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS resolution requests and directs the traffic to only healthy endpoints. You can also consider using Geo DNS and Latency Based Routing capabilities offered by Amazon Route 53.

To verify that your workload itself is highly available, use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). Amazon Route 53 can be used to target traffic to ELB, which distributes the traffic to the target compute instances. You can also use Amazon API Gateway along with AWS Lambda for a serverless solution. Customers can also run workloads in multiple AWS Regions. With [multi-site active/active pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-i-strategies-for-recovery-in-the-cloud/), the workload can serve traffic from multiple Regions. With a multi-site active/passive pattern, the workload serves traffic from the active region while data is replicated to the secondary region and becomes active in the event of a failure in the primary region. Route 53 health checks can then be used to control DNS failover from any endpoint in a primary Region to an endpoint in a secondary Region, verifying that your workload is reachable and available to your users.

Amazon CloudFront provides a simple API for distributing content with low latency and high data transfer rates by serving requests using a network of edge locations around the world. Content delivery networks (CDNs) serve customers by serving content located or cached at a location near to the user. This also improves availability of your application as the load for content is shifted away from your servers over to CloudFront’s [edge locations](https://aws.amazon.com/products/networking/edge-networking/). The edge locations and regional edge caches hold cached copies of your content close to your viewers resulting in quick retrieval and increasing reachability and availability of your workload.

For workloads with users spread out geographically, AWS Global Accelerator helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications. AWS Global Accelerator provides Anycast static IP addresses that serve as a fixed entry point to your application hosted in one or more AWS Regions. This allows traffic to ingress onto the AWS global network as close to your users as possible, improving reachability and availability of your workload. AWS Global Accelerator also monitors the health of your application endpoints by using TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS health checks. Any changes in the health or configuration of your endpoints permit redirection of user traffic to healthy endpoints that deliver the best performance and availability to your users. In addition, AWS Global Accelerator has a fault-isolating design that uses two static IPv4 addresses that are serviced by independent network zones increasing the availability of your applications.

To help protect customers from DDoS attacks, AWS provides AWS Shield Standard. Shield Standard comes automatically turned on and protects from common infrastructure (layer 3 and 4) attacks like SYN/UDP floods and reflection attacks to support high availability of your applications on AWS. For additional protections against more sophisticated and larger attacks (like UDP floods), state exhaustion attacks (like TCP SYN floods), and to help protect your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53, you can consider using AWS Shield Advanced. For protection against Application layer attacks like HTTP POST or GET floods, use AWS WAF. AWS WAF can use IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting conditions to determine if a request should be blocked or allowed.

**Implementation steps**

- Set up highly available DNS: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable [domain name system (DNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/) web service. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises. For more information, see [configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html).
- Setup health checks: When using Route 53, verify that only healthy targets are resolvable. Start by [creating Route 53 health checks and configuring DNS failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html). The following aspects are important to consider when setting up health checks:

- [Best practices for Amazon Route 53 DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-monitor-view-status.html)

- [Connect your DNS service to your endpoints.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/best-practices-dns.html)

When using Elastic Load Balancing as a target for your traffic, create an [alias record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html) using Amazon Route 53 that points to your load balancer’s regional endpoint. During the creation of the alias record, set the Evaluate target health option to Yes.
- For serverless workloads or private APIs when API Gateway is used, use [Route 53 to direct traffic to API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-api-gateway.html).

- Decide on a content delivery network.

For delivering content using edge locations closer to the user, start by understanding [how CloudFront delivers content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowCloudFrontWorks.html).
- Get started with a [simple CloudFront distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html). CloudFront then knows where you want the content to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage content delivery. The following aspects are important to understand and consider when setting up CloudFront distribution:

[How caching works with CloudFront edge locations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cache-hit-ratio-explained.html)
- [Increasing the proportion of requests that are served directly from the CloudFront caches (cache hit ratio)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cache-hit-ratio.html)

- [Optimizing high availability with CloudFront origin failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html)

- Set up application layer protection: AWS WAF helps you protect against common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. To get a deeper understanding, review [how AWS WAF works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/how-aws-waf-works.html) and when you are ready to implement protections from application layer HTTP POST AND GET floods, review [Getting started with AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html). You can also use AWS WAF with CloudFront see the documentation on [how AWS WAF works with Amazon CloudFront features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html).
- Set up additional DDoS protection: By default, all AWS customers receive protection from common, most frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or application with AWS Shield Standard at no additional charge. For additional protection of internet-facing applications running on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 you can consider [AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-summary.html) and review [examples of DDoS resilient architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-resiliency.html). To protect your workload and your public endpoints from DDoS attacks review [Getting started with AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ddos.html).

# REL02-BP02 Provision redundant connectivity between private networks in the cloud and on-premises environments

Implement redundancy in your connections between private networks in
the cloud and on-premises environments to achieve connectivity
resilience. This can be accomplished by deploying two or more links
and traffic paths, preserving connectivity in the event of network
failures.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You depend on just one network connection, which creates a single
point of failure.
- You use only one VPN tunnel or multiple tunnels that end in the same
Availability Zone.
- You rely on one ISP for VPN connectivity, which can lead to
complete failures during ISP outages.
- Not implementing dynamic routing protocols like BGP, which are
crucial for rerouting traffic during network disruptions.
- You ignore the bandwidth limitations of VPN tunnels and
overestimate their backup capabilities.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By implementing redundant connectivity between
your cloud environment and your corporate or on-premises
environment, the dependent services between the two environments can
communicate reliably.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

When using AWS Direct Connect to connect your on-premises network
to AWS, you can achieve maximum network resiliency (SLA of 99.99%)
by using separate connections that end on distinct devices in more
than one on-premises location and more than one AWS Direct Connect
location. This topology offers resilience against device failures,
connectivity issues, and complete location outages. Alternatively,
you can achieve high resiliency (SLA of 99.9%) by using two
individual connections to multiple locations (each on-premises
location connected to a single Direct Connect location). This
approach protects against connectivity disruptions caused by fiber
cuts or device failures and helps mitigate complete location
failures. The Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit can assist in
designing your AWS Direct Connect topology.

You can also consider AWS Site-to-Site VPN ending on an AWS Transit Gateway as a cost-effective backup to your primary AWS Direct Connect connection. This setup enables equal-cost multipath
(ECMP) routing across multiple VPN tunnels, allowing for
throughput of up to 50Gbps, even though each VPN tunnel is capped
at 1.25 Gbps. It's important to note, however, that AWS Direct Connect is still the most effective choice for minimizing network
disruptions and providing stable connectivity.

When using VPNs over the internet to connect your cloud
environment to your on-premises data center, configure two VPN
tunnels as part of a single site-to-site VPN connection. Each
tunnel should end in a different Availability Zone for high
availability and use redundant hardware to prevent on-premises
device failure. Additionally, consider multiple internet
connections from various internet service providers (ISPs) at your
on-premises location to avoid complete VPN connectivity disruption
due to a single ISP outage. Selecting ISPs with diverse routing
and infrastructure, especially those with separate physical paths
to AWS endpoints, provides high connectivity availability.

In addition to physical redundancy with multiple AWS Direct Connect connections and multiple VPN tunnels (or a combination of
both), implementing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) dynamic routing
is also crucial. Dynamic BGP provides automatic rerouting of
traffic from one path to another based on real-time network
conditions and configured policies. This dynamic behavior is
especially beneficial in maintaining network availability and
service continuity in the event of link or network failures. It
quickly selects alternative paths, enhancing the network's
resilience and reliability.

### Implementation steps

- Acquisition highly-available connectivity between AWS and
your on-premises environment.

Use multiple AWS Direct Connect connections or VPN
tunnels between separately deployed private networks.
- Use multiple Direct Connect locations for high
availability.
- If using multiple AWS Regions, create redundancy in at
least two of them.

- Use AWS Transit Gateway, when possible, to end your
[VPN
connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpn-attachments.html).
- Evaluate AWS Marketplace appliances to end VPNs or
[extend
your SD-WAN to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-transit-gateway-sd-wan.html).
If you use AWS Marketplace appliances, deploy redundant
instances for high availability in different Availability
Zones.
- Provide a redundant connection to your on-premises
environment.

You may need redundant connections to multiple AWS Regions to achieve your availability needs.
- Use the
[Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/resilency_toolkit.html) to get started.

# REL02-BP03 Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and availability

Amazon VPC IP address ranges must be large enough to accommodate workload requirements,
including factoring in future expansion and allocation of IP addresses to subnets across
Availability Zones. This includes load balancers, EC2 instances, and container-based
applications.

When you plan your network topology, the first step is to define the IP address space
itself. Private IP address ranges (following RFC 1918 guidelines) should be allocated for each
VPC. Accommodate the following requirements as part of this process:

- Allow IP address space for more than one VPC per Region.
- Within a VPC, allow space for multiple subnets so that you can cover multiple
Availability Zones.
- Consider leaving unused CIDR block space within a VPC for future expansion.
- Ensure that there is IP address space to meet the needs of any transient fleets of Amazon EC2
instances that you might use, such as Spot Fleets for machine learning, Amazon EMR clusters,
or Amazon Redshift clusters. Similar consideration should be given to Kubernetes clusters, such as
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), as each Kubernetes pod is assigned a routable address from the VPC CIDR
block by default.
- Note that the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block
are reserved and not available for your use.
- Note that the initial VPC CIDR block allocated to your VPC cannot be changed or deleted,
but you can add additional non-overlapping CIDR blocks to the VPC. Subnet IPv4 CIDRs cannot
be changed, however IPv6 CIDRs can.
- The largest possible VPC CIDR block is a /16, and the smallest is a /28.
- Consider other connected networks (VPC, on-premises, or other cloud providers) and
ensure non-overlapping IP address space. For more information, see [REL02-BP05 Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in all private address
spaces where they are connected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_network_topology_non_overlap_ip.html)

**Desired outcome:** A scalable IP subnet can help you accomodate
for future growth and avoid unnecessary waste.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Failing to consider future growth, resulting in CIDR blocks that are too small and
requiring reconfiguration, potentially causing downtime.
- Incorrectly estimating how many IP addresses an elastic load balancer can use.
- Deploying many high traffic load balancers into the same subnets
- Using automated scaling mechanisms whilst failing to monitor IP address
consumption.
- Defining excessively large CIDR ranges well beyond future growth expectations, which can
lead to difficulty peering with other networks with overlapping address ranges.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** This ensures that
you can accommodate the growth of your workloads and continue to provide availability as you
scale up.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

Plan your network to accommodate for growth, regulatory compliance, and integration with
others. Growth can be underestimated, regulatory compliance can change, and acquisitions or
private network connections can be difficult to implement without proper planning.

- Select relevant AWS accounts and Regions based on your service requirements,
latency, regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements.
- Identify your needs for regional VPC deployments.
- Identify the size of the VPCs.

Determine if you are going to deploy multi-VPC connectivity.

- [Single Region
Multi-VPC Connectivity](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-single-region-multi-vpc-connectivity/)

- Determine if you need segregated networking for regulatory requirements.
- Make VPCs with appropriately-sized CIDR blocks to accommodate your current and
future needs.

If you have unknown growth projections, you may wish to err on the side of
larger CIDR blocks to reduce the potential for future reconfiguration

- Consider using [IPv6 addressing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/ipv6/) for
subnets as part of a dual-stack VPC. IPv6 is well suited to being used in private
subnets containing fleets of ephemeral instances or containers that would otherwise
require large numbers of IPv4 addresses.

# REL02-BP04 Prefer hub-and-spoke topologies over many-to-many mesh

When connecting multiple private networks, such as Virtual Private
Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks, opt for a hub-and-spoke
topology over a meshed one. Unlike meshed topologies, where each
network connects directly to the others and increases the complexity
and management overhead, the hub-and-spoke architecture centralizes
connections through a single hub. This centralization simplifies the
network structure and enhances its operability, scalability, and
control.

AWS Transit Gateway is a managed, scalable, and highly-available
service designed for construction of hub-and-spoke networks on AWS.
It serves as the central hub of your network that provides network
segmentation, centralized routing, and the simplified connection to
both cloud and on-premises environments. The following figure
illustrates how you can use AWS Transit Gateway to build your
hub-and-spoke topology.

**Desired outcome:** You have
connected your Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises
networks through a central hub. You configure your peering
connections through the hub, which acts as a highly scalable cloud
router. Routing is simplified because you do not have to work with
complex peering relationships. Traffic between networks is
encrypted, and you have the ability to isolate networks.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You build complex network peering rules.
- You provide routes between networks that should not communicate
with one another (for example, separate workloads that have no
interdependencies).
- There is ineffective governance of the hub instance.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** As the number of connected networks increases,
management and expansion of meshed connectivity becomes increasingly
challenging. A mesh architecture introduces additional challenges,
such as additional infrastructure components, configuration
requirements, and deployment considerations. The mesh also
introduces additional overhead to manage and monitor the data plane
and control plane components. You must think about how to provide
high availability of the mesh architecture, how to monitor the mesh
health and performance, and how to handle upgrades of the mesh
components.

A hub-and-spoke model, on the other hand, establishes centralized
traffic routing across multiple networks. It provides a simpler
approach to management and monitoring of the data plane and control
plane components.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Create a Network Services account if one does not exist. Place the
hub in the organization's Network Services account. This approach
allows the hub to be centrally managed by network engineers.

The hub of the hub-and-spoke model acts as a virtual router for
traffic flowing between your Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and
on-premises networks. This approach reduces network complexity and
makes it easier to troubleshoot networking issues.

Consider your network design, including the VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, and Site-to-Site VPN connections you want to
interconnect.

Consider using a separate subnet for each transit gateway VPC
attachment. For each subnet, use a small CIDR (for example
/28) so that you have more address space for
compute resources. Additionally, create one network ACL, and
associate it with all of the subnets that are associated with the
hub. Keep the network ACL open in both the inbound and outbound
directions.

Design and implement your routing tables such that routes are
provided only between networks that should communicate. Omit
routes between networks that should not communicate with one
another (for example, between separate workloads that have no
inter-dependencies).

### Implementation steps

- Plan your network. Determine which networks you want to
connect, and verify that they don't share overlapping CIDR
ranges.
- Create an AWS Transit Gateway and attach your VPCs.
- If needed, create VPN connections or Direct Connect
gateways, and associate them with the Transit Gateway.
- Define how traffic is routed between the connected VPCs and
other connections through configuration of your Transit
Gateway route tables.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and adjust configurations
as necessary for performance and cost optimization.

# REL02-BP05 Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in all private address spaces where they are connected

The IP address ranges of each of your VPCs must not overlap when peered, connected via Transit Gateway, or connected over VPN. Avoid IP address conflicts between a VPC and on-premises environments or with other cloud providers that you use. You must also have a way to allocate private IP address ranges when needed. An IP address management (IPAM) system can help with automating this.

**Desired outcome:**

- No IP address range conflicts between VPCs, on-premises environments, or other cloud providers.
- Proper IP address management allows for easier scaling of network infrastructure to accommodate growth and changes in network requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using the same IP range in your VPC as you have on premises,
in your corporate network, or other cloud providers
- Not tracking IP ranges of VPCs used to deploy your workloads.
- Relying on manual IP address management processes, such as spreadsheets.
- Over- or under-sizing CIDR blocks, which results in IP address waste or insufficient address space for your workload.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Active planning of your network will ensure that you do not have multiple occurrences of the same IP address in interconnected networks. This prevents routing problems from occurring in parts of the workload that are using the different applications.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Make use of an IPAM, such as the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html), to monitor and manage your CIDR use. Several IPAMs are also available from the AWS Marketplace. Evaluate your potential usage on AWS, add CIDR ranges to existing VPCs, and create VPCs to allow planned growth in usage.

### Implementation steps

- Capture current CIDR consumption (for example, VPCs and subnets).

Use service API operations to collect current CIDR consumption.
- Use the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to discover resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with-view.html).

- Capture your current subnet usage.

Use service API operations to [collect subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSubnets.html) per VPC in each Region.
- Use the [Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to discover resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with-view.html).

- Record the current usage.
- Determine if you created any overlapping IP ranges.
- Calculate the spare capacity.
- Identify overlapping IP ranges. You can either migrate to a new range of
addresses or consider using techniques like [private NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/private-nat-gateway.html) or [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/aws-privatelink.html) if you need to connect the overlapping ranges.

## Question REL03

# REL 3 — How do you design your workload service architecture?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 3

---

# REL03-BP01 Choose how to segment your workload

Workload segmentation is important when determining the resilience requirements of your application.
Monolithic architecture should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, carefully consider which
application components can be broken out into microservices. Depending on your application requirements,
this may end up being a combination of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with microservices where
possible. Workloads that are capable of statelessness are more capable of being deployed as microservices.

**Desired outcome:** Workloads should be supportable, scalable, and as
loosely coupled as possible.

When making choices about how to segment your workload, balance the benefits against the complexities.
What is right for a new product racing to first launch is different than what a workload built to scale
from the start needs. When refactoring an existing monolith, you will need to consider how well the application
will support a decomposition towards statelessness. Breaking services into smaller pieces allows small,
well-defined teams to develop and manage them. However, smaller services can introduce complexities which
include possible increased latency, more complex debugging, and increased operational burden.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- The [microservice Death Star](https://mrtortoise.github.io/architecture/lean/design/patterns/ddd/2018/03/18/deathstar-architecture.html) is a situation in
which the atomic components become so highly interdependent that a failure of one results in
a much larger failure, making the components as rigid and fragile as a monolith.

**Benefits of establishing this practice:**

- More specific segments lead to greater agility, organizational flexibility, and scalability.
- Reduced impact of service interruptions.
- Application components may have different availability requirements, which can be supported by a more atomic segmentation.
- Well-defined responsibilities for teams supporting the workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Choose your architecture type based on how you will segment your workload. Choose an SOA
or microservices architecture (or in some rare cases, a monolithic architecture). Even if you choose to start with a
monolith architecture, you must ensure that it’s modular and can ultimately evolve to SOA or microservices as your
product scales with user adoption. SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is preferred as a
modern scalable and reliable architecture, but there are trade-offs to consider, especially when deploying a microservice
architecture.

One primary trade-off is that you now have a distributed compute architecture that can make it harder to achieve user
latency requirements and there is additional complexity in the debugging and tracing of user interactions. You can use
AWS X-Ray to assist you in solving this problem. Another effect to consider is increased operational complexity as you
increase the number of applications that you are managing, which requires the deployment of multiple independency
components.

*Monolithic, service-oriented, and microservices architectures*

## Implementation steps

- Determine the appropriate architecture to refactor or build your application.
SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is
preferred as a modern scalable and reliable architecture. SOA can be a
good compromise for achieving smaller segmentation while avoiding some of
the complexities of microservices. For more details, see [Microservice Trade-Offs](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html).
- If your workload is amenable to it, and your organization can support it, you
should use a microservices architecture to achieve the best agility and reliability.
For more details, see [Implementing
Microservices on AWS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/introduction.html)
- Consider following the [Strangler Fig pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html) to refactor a monolith into
smaller components. This involves gradually replacing specific application components with
new applications and services. [AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub-refactor-spaces/latest/userguide/what-is-mhub-refactor-spaces.html) acts as the starting point for incremental refactoring. For
more details, see [Seamlessly migrate on-premises legacy workloads using a strangler pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/seamlessly-migrate-on-premises-legacy-workloads-using-a-strangler-pattern/).
- Implementing microservices may require a service discovery mechanism to allow these
distributed services to communicate with each other. [AWS App Mesh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html) can be used
with service-oriented architectures to provide reliable discovery and access of services.
[AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) can also be used for dynamic, DNS-based
service discovery.
- If you’re migrating from a monolith to SOA, [Amazon MQ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html) can help bridge
the gap as a service bus when redesigning legacy applications in the cloud.
- For existing monoliths with a single, shared database, choose how to reorganize the
data into smaller segments. This could be by business unit, access pattern, or data
structure. At this point in the refactoring process, you should choose to move forward
with a relational or non-relational (NoSQL) type of database. For more details, see [From SQL to NoSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.html).

# REL03-BP02 Build services focused on specific business domains and functionality

Service-oriented architectures (SOA) define services with well-delineated functions defined by business needs. Microservices use domain models and bounded context to draw service boundaries along business context boundaries. Focusing on business domains and functionality helps teams define independent reliability requirements for their services. Bounded contexts isolate and encapsulate business logic, allowing teams to better reason about how to handle failures.

**Desired outcome:** Engineers and business stakeholders jointly define bounded contexts and use them to design systems as services that fulfill specific business functions. These teams use established practices like event storming to define requirements. New applications are designed as services well-defined boundaries and loosely coupling. Existing monoliths are decomposed into [bounded contexts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) and system designs move towards SOA or microservice architectures. When monoliths are refactored, established approaches like bubble contexts and monolith decomposition patterns are applied.

Domain-oriented services are executed as one or more processes that don’t share state. They independently respond to fluctuations in demand and handle fault scenarios in light of domain specific requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Teams are formed around specific technical domains like UI and UX, middleware, or database instead of specific business domains.
- Applications span domain responsibilities. Services that span bounded contexts can be more difficult to maintain, require larger testing efforts, and require multiple domain teams to participate in software updates.
- Domain dependencies, like domain entity libraries, are shared across services such that changes for one service domain require changes to other service domains
- Service contracts and business logic don’t express entities in a common and consistent domain language, resulting in translation layers that complicate systems and increase debugging efforts.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Applications are designed as independent services bounded by business domains and use a common business language. Services are independently testable and deployable. Services meet domain specific resiliency requirements for the domain implemented.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Domain-driven design (DDD) is the foundational approach of designing and building software around business domains. It’s helpful to work with an existing framework when building services focused on business domains. When working with existing monolithic applications, you can take advantage of decomposition patterns that provide established techniques to modernize applications into services.

*Domain-driven design*

## Implementation steps

- Teams can hold [event storming](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/event-storming) workshops to quickly identify events, commands, aggregates and domains in a lightweight sticky note format.
- Once domain entities and functions have been formed in a domain context, you can divide your domain into services using [bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html), where entities that share similar features and attributes are grouped together. With the model divided into contexts, a template for how to boundary microservices emerges.

For example, the Amazon.com website entities might include package, delivery, schedule, price, discount, and currency.
- Package, delivery, and schedule are grouped into the shipping context, while price, discount, and currency are grouped into the pricing context.

- [Decomposing monoliths into microservices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/modernization-decomposing-monoliths/welcome.html) outlines patterns for refactoring microservices. Using patterns for decomposition by business capability, subdomain, or transaction aligns well with domain-driven approaches.
- Tactical techniques such as the [bubble context](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettingStartedWithDDDWhenSurroundedByLegacySystemsV1.pdf) allow you to introduce DDD in existing or legacy applications without up-front rewrites and full commitments to DDD. In a bubble context approach, a small bounded context is established using a service mapping and coordination, or [anti-corruption layer](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/messages-between-bounded-context), which protects the newly defined domain model from external influences.

After teams have performed domain analysis and defined entities and service contracts, they can take advantage of AWS services to implement their domain-driven design as cloud-based services.

- Start your development by defining tests that exercise business rules of your domain. Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) help teams keep services focused on solving business problems.
- Select the [AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/) that best meet your business domain requirements and [microservice architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/microservices-on-aws.html):

[AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) allows your team focus on specific domain logic instead of managing servers and infrastructure.
- [Containers at AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/) simplify the management of your infrastructure, so you can focus on your domain requirements.
- [Purpose built databases](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/) help you match your domain requirements to the best fit database type.

- [Building hexagonal architectures on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/hexagonal-architectures/welcome.html) outlines a framework to build business logic into services working backwards from a business domain to fulfill functional requirements and then attach integration adapters. Patterns that separate interface details from business logic with AWS services help teams focus on domain functionality and improve software quality.

# REL03-BP03 Provide service contracts per API

Service contracts are documented agreements between API producers and consumers defined in a machine-readable API definition. A contract versioning strategy allows consumers to continue using the existing API and migrate their applications to a newer API when they are ready. Producer deployment can happen any time as long as the contract is followed. Service teams can use the technology stack of their choice to satisfy the API contract.

**Desired outcome:** Applications built with service-oriented or microservice architectures are able to operate independently while having integrated runtime dependency. Changes deployed to an API consumer or producer do not interrupt the stability of the overall system when both sides follow a common API contract. Components that communicate over service APIs can perform independent functional releases, upgrades to runtime dependencies, or fail over to a disaster recovery (DR) site with little or no impact to each other. In addition, discrete services are able to independently scale absorbing resource demand without requiring other services to scale in unison.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Creating service APIs without strongly typed schemas. This results in APIs that cannot be used to generate API bindings and payloads that can’t be programmatically validated.
- Not adopting a versioning strategy, which forces API consumers to update and release or fail when service contracts evolve.
- Error messages that leak details of the underlying service implementation rather than describe integration failures in the domain context and language.
- Not using API contracts to develop test cases and mock API implementations to allow for independent testing of service components.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Distributed systems composed of components that communicate over API service contracts can improve reliability. Developers can catch potential issues early in the development process with type checking during compilation to verify that requests and responses follow the API contract and required fields are present. API contracts provide a clear self-documenting interface for APIs and provider better interoperability between different systems and programming languages.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Once you have identified business domains and determined your workload segmentation, you can develop your service APIs. First, define machine-readable service contracts for APIs, and then implement an API versioning strategy. When you are ready to integrate services over common protocols like REST, GraphQL, or asynchronous events, you can incorporate AWS services into your architecture to integrate your components with strongly-typed API contracts.

**AWS services for service API contrats**

Incorporate AWS services including [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/), and [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) into your architecture to use API service contracts in your application. Amazon API Gateway helps you integrate with directly native AWS services and other web services. API Gateway supports the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) and versioning. AWS AppSync is a managed [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoint you configure by defining a GraphQL schema to define a service interface for queries, mutations and subscriptions. Amazon EventBridge uses event schemas to define events and generate code bindings for your events.

## Implementation steps

- First, define a contract for your API. A contract will express the capabilities of an API as well as define strongly typed data objects and fields for the API input and output.
- When you configure APIs in API Gateway, you can import and export OpenAPI Specifications for your endpoints.

[Importing an OpenAPI definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/import-edge-optimized-api.html) simplifies the creation of your API and can be integrated with AWS infrastructure as code tools like the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) and [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
- [Exporting an API definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-export-api.html) simplifies integrating with API testing tools and provides services consumer an integration specification.

- You can define and manage GraphQL APIs with AWS AppSync by [defining a GraphQL schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-your-schema.html) file to generate your contract interface and simplify interaction with complex REST models, multiple database tables or legacy services.
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) projects that are integrated with AWS AppSync generate strongly typed JavaScript query files for use in your application as well as an AWS AppSync GraphQL client library for [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables.
- When you consume service events from Amazon EventBridge, events adhere to schemas that already exist in the schema registry or that you define with the OpenAPI Spec. With a schema defined in the registry, you can also generate client bindings from the schema contract to integrate your code with events.
- Extending or version your API. Extending an API is a simpler option when adding fields that can be configured with optional fields or default values for required fields.

JSON based contracts for protocols like REST and GraphQL can be a good fit for contract extension.
- XML based contracts for protocols like SOAP should be tested with service consumers to determine the feasibility of contract extension.

- When versioning an API, consider implementing proxy versioning where a facade is used to support versions so that logic can be maintained in a single codebase.

With API Gateway you can use [request and response mappings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html#transforming-request-response-body) to simplify absorbing contract changes by establishing a facade to provide default values for new fields or to strip removed fields from a request or response. With this approach the underlying service can maintain a single codebase.

## Question REL04

# REL 4 — How do you design interactions in a distributed system to prevent failures?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# REL04-BP01 Identify the kind of distributed systems you depend on

Distributed systems can be synchronous, asynchronous, or batch.
Synchronous systems must process requests as quickly as possible and
communicate with each other by making synchronous request and
response calls using HTTP/S, REST, or remote procedure call (RPC)
protocols. Asynchronous systems communicate with each other by
exchanging data asynchronously through an intermediary service
without coupling individual systems. Batch systems receive a large
volume of input data, run automated data processes without human
intervention, and generate output data.

**Desired outcome**: Design a
workload that effectively interacts with synchronous, asynchronous,
and batch dependencies.

**Common anti-patterns**:

- Workload waits indefinitely for a response from its
dependencies, which could lead to workload clients timing out,
not knowing if their request has been received.
- Workload uses a chain of dependent systems that call each other
synchronously. This requires each system to be available and to
successfully process a request before the whole chain can
succeed, leading to potentially brittle behavior and overall
availability.
- Workload communicates with its dependencies asynchronously and
rely on the concept of exactly-once guaranteed delivery of
messages, when often it is still possible to receive duplicate
messages.
- Workload does not use proper batch scheduling tools and allows
concurrent execution of the same batch job.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice**: It is common for a given workload to implement
one or more style of communication between synchronous,
asynchronous, and batch. This best practice helps you identify the
different trade-offs associated with each style of communication to
make your workload able to tolerate disruptions in any of its
dependencies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established**: High

## Implementation guidance

The following sections contain both general and specific
implementation guidance for each kind of dependency.

**General guidance**

- Make sure that the performance and reliability service-level
objectives (SLOs) that your dependencies offer meet the
performance and reliability requirements of your workload.
- Use
[AWS observability services](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudops/monitoring-and-observability) to
[monitor
response times and error rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7uFFyHIX0) to make sure your
dependency is providing service at the levels needed by your
workload.
- Identify the potential challenges that your workload may face
when communicating with its dependencies. Distributed systems
[come
with a wide range of challenges](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/challenges-with-distributed-systems/) that might increase
architectural complexity, operational burden, and cost. Common
challenges include latency, network disruptions, data loss,
scaling, and data replication lag.
- Implement robust error handling and
[logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)
to help you troubleshoot problems when your dependency
experiences issues.

**Synchronous dependency**

In synchronous communications, your workload sends a request to its
dependency and blocks the operation waiting for a response. When its
dependency receives the request, it tries to handle it as soon as
possible and sends a response back to your workload. A significant
challenge with synchronous communication is that it causes temporal
coupling, which requires your workload and its dependencies to be
available at the same time. When your workload needs to communicate
synchronously with its dependencies, consider the following
guidance:

- Your workload should not rely on multiple synchronous
dependencies to perform a single function. This chain of
dependencies increases overall brittleness because all
dependencies in the pathway need to be available in order for
the request to complete successfully.
- When a dependency is unhealthy or unavailable, determine your
error handling and retry strategies. Avoid using bimodal
behavior. Bimodal behavior is when your workload exhibits
different behavior under normal and failure modes. For more
details on bimodal behavior, see
[REL11-BP05
Use static stability to prevent bimodal behavior.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_withstand_component_failures_static_stability.html)
- Keep in mind that failing fast is better than making your
workload wait. For instance, the
[AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html) describes how to handle retries
and failures when you invoke Lambda functions.
- Set timeouts when your workload calls its dependency. This
technique avoids waiting too long or waiting indefinitely for a
response. For helpful discussion of this issue, see
[Tuning
AWS Java SDK HTTP request settings for latency-aware Amazon DynamoDB applications](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/tuning-aws-java-sdk-http-request-settings-for-latency-aware-amazon-dynamodb-applications/).
- Minimize the number of calls made from your workload to its
dependency to fulfill a single request. Having chatty calls
between them increases coupling and latency.

**Asynchronous dependency**

To temporally decouple your workload from its dependency, they
should communicate asynchronously. Using an asynchronous approach,
your workload can continue with any other processing without having
to wait for its dependency, or chain of dependencies, to send a
response.

When your workload needs to communicate asynchronously with its
dependency, consider the following guidance:

- Determine whether to use messaging or event streaming based on
your use case and requirements.
[Messaging](https://aws.amazon.com/messaging/)
allows your workload to communicate with its dependency by
sending and receiving messages through a message broker.
[Event
streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/streaming-data/) allows your workload and its dependency to use
a streaming service to publish and subscribe to events,
delivered as continuous streams of data, that need to be
processed as soon as possible.

- Messaging and event streaming handle messages differently so you
need to make trade-off decisions based on:

**Message priority:** message
brokers can process high-priority messages ahead of normal
messages. In event streaming, all messages have the same
priority.
- **Message consumption**:
message brokers ensure that consumers receive the message.
Event streaming consumers must keep track of the last
message they have read.
- **Message ordering**: with
messaging, receiving messages in the exact order they are
sent is not guaranteed unless you use a first-in-first-out
(FIFO) approach. Event streaming always preserves the order
in which the data was produced.
- **Message deletion**: with
messaging, the consumer must delete the message after
processing it. The event streaming service appends the
message to a stream and remains in there until the message's
retention period expires. This deletion policy makes event
streaming suitable for replaying messages.

- Define how your workload knows when its dependency completes its
work. For instance, when your workload invokes a
[Lambda
function asynchronously](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html), Lambda places the event in a
queue and returns a success response without additional
information. After processing is complete, the Lambda function
can
[send
the result to a destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-destinations), configurable based on
success or failure.
- Build your workload to handle duplicate messages by leveraging
idempotency. Idempotency means that the results of your workload
do not change even if your workload is generated more than once
for the same message. It is important to point out that
[messaging](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/#FIFO_queues)
or
[streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-duplicates.html)
services will redeliver a message if a network failure occurs or
if an acknowledgement has not been received.
- If your workload does not get a response from its dependency, it
needs to resubmit the request. Consider limiting the number of
retries to preserve your workload's CPU, memory, and network
resources to handle other requests. The
[AWS Lambda documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-errors) shows how to handle errors for
asynchronous invocation.
- Leverage suitable observability, debugging, and tracing tools to
manage and operate your workload's asynchronous communication
with its dependency. You can use
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to monitor
[messaging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
and
[event
streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html) services. You can also instrument your workload
with [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) to quickly
[gain
insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html) for troubleshooting problems.

**Batch dependency**

Batch systems take input data, initiate a series of jobs to process
it, and produce some output data, without manual intervention.
Depending on the data size, jobs could run from minutes to, in some
cases, several days. When your workload communicates with its batch
dependency, consider the following guidance:

- Define the time window when your workload should run the batch
job. Your workload can set up a recurrence pattern to invoke a
batch system, for example, every hour or at the end of every
month.
- Determine the location of the data input and the processed data
output. Choose a storage service, such as
[Amazon Simple Storage Services (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html), and
[Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html), that allows your workload to read and
write files at scale.
- If your workload needs to invoke multiple batch jobs, you could
leverage
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/?step-functions.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&step-functions.sort-order=desc) to simplify the orchestration of batch
jobs that run in AWS or on-premises. This
[sample
project](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-stepfunction-complex-orchestrator-app) demonstrates orchestration of batch jobs using
Step Functions,
[AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/), and Lambda.
- Monitor batch jobs to look for abnormalities, such as a job
taking longer than it should to complete. You could use tools
like
[CloudWatch
Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) to monitor AWS Batch environments and
jobs. In this instance, your workload would stop the next job
from beginning and inform the relevant staff of the exception.

# REL04-BP02 Implement loosely coupled dependencies

Dependencies such as queuing systems, streaming systems, workflows,
and load balancers are loosely coupled. Loose coupling helps isolate
behavior of a component from other components that depend on it,
increasing resiliency and agility.

Decoupling dependencies, such as queuing systems, streaming systems, and workflows, help minimize the impact of changes or failure on a system. This separation isolates a component's behavior from affecting others that depend on it, improving resilience and agility.

In tightly coupled systems, changes to one component can necessitate changes in other components that rely on it, resulting in degraded performance across all components. *Loose* coupling breaks this dependency so that dependent components only need to know the versioned and published interface. Implementing loose coupling between dependencies isolates a failure in one from impacting another.

Loose coupling allows you to modify code or add features to a component while minimizing risk to other components that depend on it. It also allows for granular resilience at a component level where you can scale out or even change underlying implementation of the dependency.

To further improve resiliency through loose coupling, make component
interactions asynchronous where possible. This model is suitable for
any interaction that does not need an immediate response and where
an acknowledgment that a request has been registered will suffice.
It involves one component that generates events and another that
consumes them. The two components do not integrate through direct
point-to-point interaction but usually through an intermediate
durable storage layer, such as an Amazon SQS queue, a streaming data
platform such as Amazon Kinesis, or AWS Step Functions.

*Figure 4: Dependencies such as queuing systems and load
balancers are loosely coupled*

Amazon SQS queues and AWS Step Functions are just two ways to
add an intermediate layer for loose coupling. Event-driven
architectures can also be built in the AWS Cloud using Amazon EventBridge, which can abstract clients (event producers) from the
services they rely on (event consumers). Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is an effective solution when you need
high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large
number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing.

While queues offer several advantages, in most hard real-time
systems, requests older than a threshold time (often seconds) should
be considered stale (the client has given up and is no longer
waiting for a response), and not processed. This way more recent
(and likely still valid requests) can be processed instead.

**Desired outcome:** Implementing loosely coupled dependencies allows you to minimize the surface area for failure to a component level, which helps diagnose and resolve issues. It also simplifies development cycles, allowing teams to implement changes at a modular level without affecting the performance of other components that depend on it. This approach provides the capability to scale out at a component level based on resource needs, as well as utilization of a component contributing to cost-effectiveness.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying a monolithic workload.
- Directly invoking APIs between workload tiers with no capability
of failover or asynchronous processing of the request.
- Tight coupling using shared data. Loosely coupled systems should avoid sharing data through shared databases or other forms of tightly coupled data storage, which can reintroduce tight coupling and hinder scalability.
- Ignoring back pressure. Your workload should have the ability to slow down or stop incoming data when a component can't process it at the same rate.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a
component from other components that depend on it, increasing
resiliency and agility. Failure in one component is isolated from
others.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement loosely coupled dependencies. There are various solutions that allow you to build loosely coupled applications. These include services for implementing fully managed queues, automated workflows, react to events, and APIs among others which can help isolate behavior of components from other components, and as such increasing resilience and agility.

- **Build event-driven architectures:** [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) helps you build loosely coupled and distributed event-driven architectures.
- **Implement queues in distributed systems:** You can use [Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html) to integrate and decouple distributed systems.
- **Containerize components as microservices:** [Microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/) allow teams to build applications composed of small independent components which communicate over well-defined APIs. [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html), and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) can help you get started faster with containers.
- **Manage workflows with Step Functions:** [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/getting-started/) help you coordinate multiple AWS services into flexible workflows.
- **Leverage publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging architectures:** [Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers).

### Implementation steps

- Components in an event-driven architecture are initiated by events. Events are actions that happen in a system, such as a user adding an item to a cart. When an action is successful, an event is generated that actuates the next component of the system.

- [AWS re:Invent 2022 - Designing Event-Driven Integrations using Amazon EventBridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Rh70jG-LM)

- Distributed messaging systems have three main parts that need to be implemented for a queue based architecture. They include components of the distributed system, the queue that is used for decoupling (distributed on Amazon SQS servers), and the messages in the queue. A typical system has producers which initiate the message into the queue, and the consumer which receives the message from the queue. The queue stores messages across multiple Amazon SQS servers for redundancy.

- [Send Messages Between Distributed Applications with Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/send-messages-distributed-applications/)

- Microservices, when well-utilized, enhance maintainability and boost scalability, as loosely coupled components are managed by independent teams. It also allows for the isolation of behaviors to a single component in case of changes.

# REL04-BP03 Do constant work

Systems can fail when there are large, rapid changes in load. For
example, if your workload is doing a health check that monitors the
health of thousands of servers, it should send the same size payload
(a full snapshot of the current state) each time. Whether no servers
are failing, or all of them, the health check system is doing
constant work with no large, rapid changes.

For example, if the health check system is monitoring 100,000
servers, the load on it is nominal under the normally light server
failure rate. However, if a major event makes half of those servers
unhealthy, then the health check system would be overwhelmed trying
to update notification systems and communicate state to its clients.
So instead the health check system should send the full snapshot of
the current state each time. 100,000 server health states, each
represented by a bit, would only be a 12.5-KB payload. Whether no
servers are failing, or all of them are, the health check system is
doing constant work, and large, rapid changes are not a threat to
the system stability. This is actually how Amazon Route 53 handles
health checks for endpoints (such as IP addresses) to determine how
end users are routed to them.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

- Do constant work so that systems do not fail when there are large,
rapid changes in load.
- Implement loosely coupled dependencies. Dependencies such as
queuing systems, streaming systems, workflows, and load balancers
are loosely coupled. Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a
component from other components that depend on it, increasing
resiliency and agility.

For the example of a health check system monitoring 100,000 servers, engineer
workloads so that payload sizes remain constant regardless of number of successes
or failures.

# REL04-BP04 Make mutating operations idempotent

An idempotent service promises that each request is processed
exactly once, such that making multiple identical requests has the
same effect as making a single request. This makes it easier for a
client to implement retries without fear that a request is
erroneously processed multiple times. To do this, clients can issue
API requests with an idempotency token, which is used whenever the
request is repeated. An idempotent service API uses the token to
return a response identical to the response that was returned the
first time that the request was completed, even if the underlying
state of the system has changed.

In a distributed system, it is relatively simple to perform an
action at most once (client makes only one request) or at least once
(keep requesting until client gets confirmation of success). It is
more difficult to guarantee an action is performed *exactly
once*, such that making multiple identical requests has
the same effect as making a single request. Using idempotency tokens
in APIs, services can receive a mutating request one or more times
without the need to create duplicate records or side effects.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
consistent, well-documented, and widely adopted approach for
ensuring idempotency across all components and services.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You apply idempotency indiscriminately, even when not needed.
- You introduce overly complex logic for implementing idempotency.
- You use timestamps as keys for idempotency. This can cause
inaccuracies due to clock skew or due to multiple clients that
use the same timestamps to apply changes.
- You store entire payloads for idempotency. In this approach, you
save complete data payloads for every request and overwrite it
at each new request. This can degrade performance and affect
scalability.
- You generate keys inconsistently across services. Without
consistent keys, services may fail to recognize duplicate
requests, which results in unintended results.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Greater scalability: The system can handle retries and duplicate
requests without having to perform additional logic or complex
state management.
- Enhanced reliability: Idempotency helps services handle multiple
identical requests in a consistent manner, which reduces the
risk of unintended side effects or duplicate records. This is
especially crucial in distributed systems, where network
failures and retries are common.
- Improved data consistency: Because the same request produces the
same response, idempotency helps maintain data consistency
across distributed systems. This is essential to maintain the
integrity of transactions and operations.
- Error handling: Idempotency tokens make error handling more
straightforward. If a client does not receive a response due to
an issue, it can safely resend the request with the same
idempotency token.
- Operational transparency: Idempotency allows for better
monitoring and logging. Services can log requests with their
idempotency tokens, which makes it easier to trace and debug
issues.
- Simplified API contract: It can simplify the contract between
the client and server side systems and reduce the fear of
erroneous data processing.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

In a distributed system, performing an action at most once (the
client makes only one request) or at least once (the client keeps
requesting until success is confirmed) is relatively
straightforward. However, it's challenging to implement
*exactly once* behavior. To achieve this, your
clients should generate and provide an idempotency token for each
request.

By using idempotency tokens, a service can distinguish between new
requests and repeated ones. When a service receives a request with
an idempotency token, it checks if the token has already been
used. If the token has been used, the service retrieves and
returns the stored response. If the token is new, the service
processes the request, stores the response along with the token,
and then returns the response. This mechanism makes all responses
idempotent, which enhances the reliability and consistency of the
distributed system.

Idempotency is also an important behavior of event-driven
architectures. These architectures are typically backed by a
message queue such as Amazon SQS, Amazon MQ, Amazon Kinesis
Streams, or Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). In some
circumstances, a message that was published only once may be
accidentally delivered more than once. When a publisher generates
and includes idempotency tokens in messages, it requests that the
processing of any duplicate message received doesn't result in a
repeated action for the same message. Consumers should keep track
of each token received and ignore messages that contain duplicate
tokens.

Services and consumers should also pass the received idempotency
token to any downstream services that it calls. Every downstream
service in the processing chain is similarly responsible for
making sure that idempotency is implemented to avoid the side
effect of processing a message more than once.

### Implementation steps

- **Identify idempotent
operations**

Determine which operations require idempotency. These
typically include POST,
PUT, and DELETE HTTP
methods and database insert, update, or delete operations.
Operations that do not mutate state, such as read-only
queries, usually do not require idempotency unless they have
side effects.
- **Use unique identifiers**

Include a unique token in each idempotent operation request
sent by the sender, either directly in the request or as
part of its metadata (for example, an HTTP header). This
allows the receiver to recognize and handle duplicate
requests or operations. Identifiers commonly used for tokens
include
[Universally
Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562) and

[K-Sortable
Unique Identifiers (KSUIDs)](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid).
- **Track and manage state**

Maintain the state of each operation or request in your
workload. This can be achieved by storing the idempotency
token and the corresponding state (such as
pending, completed, or
failed) in a database, cache, or other
persistent store. This state information allows the workload
to identify and handle duplicate requests or operations.

Maintain consistency and atomicity by using appropriate
concurrency control mechanisms if needed, such as locks,
transactions, or optimistic concurrency controls. This
includes the process of recording the idempotent token and
running all mutating operations associated with servicing
the request. This helps prevent race conditions and verifies
that idempotent operations run correctly.

Regularly remove old idempotency tokens from the datastore
to manage storage and performance. If your storage system
supports it, consider using expiration timestamps for data
(often known as time to live, or TTL values). The likelihood
of idempotency token reuse diminishes over time.

Common AWS storage options typically used for storing
idempotency tokens and related state include:

**Amazon DynamoDB**:
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that provides
low-latency performance and high availability, which
makes it well-suited for the storage of
idempotency-related data. The key-value and document
data model of DynamoDB allows for efficient storage and
retrieval of idempotency tokens and associated state
information. DynamoDB can also expire idempotency tokens
automatically if your application sets a TTL value when
it inserts them.
- **Amazon ElastiCache**:
ElastiCache can store idempotency tokens with high
throughput, low latency, and at low cost. Both
ElastiCache (Redis) and ElastiCache (Memcached) can also
expire idempotency tokens automatically if your
application sets a TTL value when it inserts them.
- **Amazon Relational Database Service
(RDS):** You can use Amazon RDS to store idempotency
tokens and related state information, especially if your
application already uses a relational database for other
purposes.
- **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):** Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that can be used to store idempotency tokens and related metadata. The versioning capabilities of S3 can be particularly useful for maintenance of the state of idempotent operations.

The choice of storage service typically depends on factors such as the volume of idempotency-related data, the required performance characteristics, the need for durability and availability, and how the idempotency mechanism integrates with the overall workload architecture.

- **Implement idempotent
operations**

Design your API and workload components to be idempotent.
Incorporate idempotency checks into your workload
components. Before you process a request or perform an
operation, check if the unique identifier has already been
processed. If it has, return the previous result instead of
executing the operation again. For example, if a client
sends a request to create a user, check if a user with the
same unique identifier already exists. If the user exists,
it should return the existing user information instead of
creating a new one. Similarly, if a queue consumer receives
a message with a duplicate idempotency token, the consumer
should ignore the message.

Create comprehensive test suites that validate the
idempotency of requests. They should cover a wide range of
scenarios, such as successful requests, failed requests, and
duplicate requests.

If your workload leverages AWS Lambda functions, consider
Powertools for AWS Lambda. Powertools for AWS Lambda is a
developer toolkit that helps implement serverless best
practices and increase developer velocity when you work with
AWS Lambda functions. In particular, it provides a utility
to convert your Lambda functions into idempotent operations
which are safe to retry.
- **Communicate idempotency
clearly**

Document your API and workload components to clearly
communicate the idempotent nature of the operations. This
helps clients understand the expected behavior and how to
interact with your workload reliably.
- **Monitor and audit**

Implement monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect any
issues related to the idempotency of responses, such as
unexpected response variations or excessive duplicate
request handling. This can help you detect and investigate
any issues or unexpected behaviors in your workload.

# REL05-BP01 Implement graceful degradation to transform applicable hard dependencies into soft dependencies

Application components should continue to perform their core function even if dependencies become unavailable. They might be serving slightly stale data, alternate data, or even no data. This ensures overall system function is only minimally impeded by localized failures while delivering the central business value.

**Desired outcome:** When a component's dependencies are unhealthy, the component itself can still function, although in a degraded manner. Failure modes of components should be seen as normal operation. Workflows should be designed in such a way that such failures do not lead to complete failure or at least to predictable and recoverable states.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not identifying the core business functionality needed. Not testing that components are functional even during dependency failures.
- Serving no data on errors or when only one out of multiple dependencies is unavailable and partial results can still be returned.
- Creating an inconsistent state when a transaction partially fails.
- Not having an alternative way to access a central parameter store.
- Invalidating or emptying local state as a result of a failed refresh without considering the consequences of doing so.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Graceful degradation improves the availability of the system as a whole and maintains the functionality of the most important functions even during failures.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing graceful degradation helps minimize the impact of dependency failures on component function. Ideally, a component detects dependency failures and works around them in a way that minimally impacts other components or customers.

Architecting for graceful degradation means considering potential failure modes during dependency design. For each failure mode, have a way to deliver most or at least the most critical functionality of the component to callers or customers. These considerations can become additional requirements that can be tested and verified. Ideally, a component is able to perform its core function in an acceptable manner even when one or multiple dependencies fail.

This is as much a business discussion as a technical one. All business requirements are important and should be fulfilled if possible. However, it still makes sense to ask what should happen when not all of them can be fulfilled. A system can be designed to be available and consistent, but under circumstances where one requirement must be dropped, which one is more important? For payment processing, it might be consistency. For a real-time application, it might be availability. For a customer facing website, the answer may depend on customer expectations.

What this means depends on the requirements of the component and what should be considered its core function. For example:

- An ecommerce website might display data from multiple different systems like personalized recommendations, highest ranked products, and status of customer orders on the landing page. When one upstream system fails, it still makes sense to display everything else instead of showing an error page to a customer.
- A component performing batch writes can still continue processing a batch if one of the individual operations fails. It should be simple to implement a retry mechanism. This can be done by returning information on which operations succeeded, which failed, and why they failed to the caller, or putting failed requests into a dead letter queue to implement asynchronous retries. Information about failed operations should be logged as well.
- A system that processes transactions must verify that either all or no individual updates are executed. For distributed transactions, the saga pattern can be used to roll back previous operations in case a later operation of the same transaction fails. Here, the core function is maintaining consistency.
- Time critical systems should be able to deal with dependencies not responding in a timely manner. In these cases, the circuit breaker pattern can be used. When responses from a dependency start timing out, the system can switch to a closed state where no additional call are made.
- An application may read parameters from a parameter store. It can be useful to create container images with a default set of parameters and use these in case the parameter store is unavailable.

Note that the pathways taken in case of component failure need to be tested and should be significantly simpler than the primary pathway. Generally, [fallback strategies should be avoided](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/).

## Implementation steps

Identify external and internal dependencies. Consider what kinds of failures can occur in them. Think about ways that minimize negative impact on upstream and downstream systems and customers during those failures.

The following is a list of dependencies and how to degrade gracefully when they fail:

- **Partial failure of dependencies:** A component may make multiple requests to downstream systems, either as multiple requests to one system or one request to multiple systems each. Depending on the business context, different ways of handling for this may be appropriate (for more detail, see previous examples in Implementation guidance).
- **A downstream system is unable to process requests due to high load:** If requests to a downstream system are consistently failing, it does not make sense to continue retrying. This may create additional load on an already overloaded system and make recovery more difficult. The circuit breaker pattern can be utilized here, which monitors failing calls to a downstream system. If a high number of calls are failing, it will stop sending more requests to the downstream system and only occasionally let calls through to test whether the downstream system is available again.
- **A parameter store is unavailable:** To transform a parameter store, soft dependency caching or sane defaults included in container or machine images may be used. Note that these defaults need to be kept up-to-date and included in test suites.
- **A monitoring service or other non-functional dependency is unavailable:** If a component is intermittently unable to send logs, metrics, or traces to a central monitoring service, it is often best to still execute business functions as usual. Silently not logging or pushing metrics for a long time is often not acceptable. Also, some use cases may require complete auditing entries to fulfill compliance requirements.
- **A primary instance of a relational database may be unavailable:** Amazon Relational Database Service, like almost all relational databases, can only have one primary writer instance. This creates a single point of failure for write workloads and makes scaling more difficult. This can partially be mitigated by using a Multi-AZ configuration for high availability or Amazon Aurora Serverless for better scaling. For very high availability requirements, it can make sense to not rely on the primary writer at all. For queries that only read, read replicas can be used, which provide redundancy and the ability to scale out, not just up. Writes can be buffered, for example in an Amazon Simple Queue Service queue, so that write requests from customers can still be accepted even if the primary is temporarily unavailable.

# REL05-BP02 Throttle requests

Throttle requests to mitigate resource exhaustion due to unexpected increases in demand. Requests below throttling rates are processed while those over the defined limit are rejected with a return message indicating the request was throttled.

**Desired outcome:** Large volume spikes either from sudden customer traffic increases, flooding attacks, or retry storms are mitigated by request throttling, allowing workloads to continue normal processing of supported request volume.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- API endpoint throttles are not implemented or are left at default values without considering expected volumes.
- API endpoints are not load tested or throttling limits are not tested.
- Throttling request rates without considering request size or complexity.
- Testing maximum request rates or maximum request size, but not testing both together.
- Resources are not provisioned to the same limits established in testing.
- Usage plans have not been configured or considered for application to application (A2A) API consumers.
- Queue consumers that horizontally scale do not have maximum concurrency settings configured.
- Rate limiting on a per IP address basis has not been implemented.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Workloads that set throttle limits are able to operate normally and process accepted request load successfully under unexpected volume spikes. Sudden or sustained spikes of requests to APIs and queues are throttled and do not exhaust request processing resources. Rate limits throttle individual requestors so that high volumes of traffic from a single IP address or API consumer will not exhaust resources impact other consumers.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Services should be designed to process a known capacity of requests; this capacity can be established through load testing. If request arrival rates exceed limits, the appropriate response signals that a request has been throttled. This allows the consumer to handle the error and retry later.

When your service requires a throttling implementation, consider implementing the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request. Tokens are refilled at a throttle rate per second and emptied asynchronously by one token per request.

*The token bucket algorithm.*

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) implements the token bucket algorithm according to account and region limits and can be configured per-client with usage plans. Additionally, [Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) can buffer requests to smooth out the request rate, and allow higher throttling rates for requests that can be addressed. Finally, you can implement rate limiting with [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) to throttle specific API consumers that generate unusually high load.

## Implementation steps

You can configure API Gateway with throttling limits for your APIs and return `429 Too Many Requests` errors when limits are exceeded. You can use AWS WAF with your AWS AppSync and API Gateway endpoints to enable rate limiting on a per IP address basis. Additionally, where your system can tolerate asynchronous processing, you can put messages into a queue or stream to speed up responses to service clients, which allows you to burst to higher throttle rates.

With asynchronous processing, when you’ve configured Amazon SQS as an event source for AWS Lambda, you can [configure maximum concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#events-sqs-max-concurrency) to avoid high event rates from consuming available account concurrent execution quota needed for other services in your workload or account.

While API Gateway provides a managed implementation of the token bucket, in cases where you cannot use API Gateway, you can take advantage of language specific open-source implementations (see related examples in Resources) of the token bucket for your services.

- Understand and configure [API Gateway throttling limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-throttling.html) at the account level per region, API per stage, and API key per usage plan levels.
- Apply [AWS WAF rate limiting rules](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/three-most-important-aws-waf-rate-based-rules/) to API Gateway and AWS AppSync endpoints to protect against floods and block malicious IPs. Rate limiting rules can also be configured on AWS AppSync API keys for A2A consumers.
- Consider whether you require more throttling control than rate limiting for AWS AppSync APIs, and if so, configure an API Gateway in front of your AWS AppSync endpoint.
- When Amazon SQS queues are set up as triggers for Lambda queue consumers, set [maximum concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#events-sqs-max-concurrency) to a value that processes enough to meet your service level objectives but does not consume concurrency limits impacting other Lambda functions. Consider setting reserved concurrency on other Lambda functions in the same account and region when you consume queues with Lambda.
- Use API Gateway with native service integrations to Amazon SQS or Kinesis to buffer requests.
- If you cannot use API Gateway, look at language specific libraries to implement the token bucket algorithm for your workload. Check the examples section and do your own research to find a suitable library.
- Test limits that you plan to set, or that you plan to allow to be increased, and document the tested limits.
- Do not increase limits beyond what you establish in testing. When increasing a limit, verify that provisioned resources are already equivalent to or greater than those in test scenarios before applying the increase.

# REL05-BP03 Control and limit retry calls

Use exponential backoff to retry requests at progressively longer intervals between each retry. Introduce jitter between retries to randomize retry intervals. Limit the maximum number of retries.

**Desired outcome:** Typical components in a distributed software system include servers, load balancers, databases, and DNS servers. During normal operation, these components can respond to requests with errors that are temporary or limited, and also errors that would be persistent regardless of retries. When clients make requests to services, the requests consume resources including memory, threads, connections, ports, or any other limited resources. Controlling and limiting retries is a strategy to release and minimize consumption of resources so that system components under strain are not overwhelmed.

When client requests time out or receive error responses, they should determine whether or not to retry. If they do retry, they do so with exponential backoff with jitter and a maximum retry value. As a result, backend services and processes are given relief from load and time to self-heal, resulting in faster recovery and successful request servicing.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing retries without adding exponential backoff, jitter, and maximum retry values. Backoff and jitter help avoid artificial traffic spikes due to unintentionally coordinated retries at common intervals.
- Implementing retries without testing their effects or assuming retries are already built into an SDK without testing retry scenarios.
- Failing to understand published error codes from dependencies, leading to retrying all errors, including those with a clear cause that indicates lack of permission, configuration error, or another condition that predictably will not resolve without manual intervention.
- Not addressing observability practices, including monitoring and alerting on repeated service failures so that underlying issues are made known and can be addressed.
- Developing custom retry mechanisms when built-in or third-party retry capabilities suffice.
- Retrying at multiple layers of your application stack in a manner which compounds retry attempts further consuming resources in a retry storm. Be sure to understand how these errors affect your application the dependencies you rely on, then implement retries at only one level.
- Retrying service calls that are not idempotent, causing unexpected side effects like duplicated results.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Retries help clients acquire desired results when requests fail but also consume more of a server’s time to get the successful responses they want. When failures are rare or transient, retries work well. When failures are caused by resource overload, retries can make things worse. Adding exponential backoff with jitter to client retries allows servers to recover when failures are caused by resource overload. Jitter avoids alignment of requests into spikes, and backoff diminishes load escalation caused by adding retries to normal request load. Finally, it’s important to configure a maximum number of retries or elapsed time to avoid creating backlogs that produce metastable failures.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Control and limit retry calls. Use exponential backoff to retry after progressively longer intervals. Introduce jitter to randomize retry intervals and limit the maximum number of retries.

Some AWS SDKs implement retries and exponential backoff by default. Use these built-in AWS implementations where applicable in your workload. Implement similar logic in your workload when calling services that are idempotent and where retries improve your client availability. Decide what the timeouts are and when to stop retrying based on your use case. Build and exercise testing scenarios for those retry use cases.

## Implementation steps

- Determine the optimal layer in your application stack to implement retries for the services your application relies on.
- Be aware of existing SDKs that implement proven retry strategies with exponential backoff and jitter for your language of choice, and favor these over writing your own retry implementations.
- Verify that [services are idempotent](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/) before implementing retries. Once retries are implemented, be sure they are both tested and regularly exercise in production.
- When calling AWS service APIs, use the [AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-retry-behavior.html) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-retries.html) and understand the retry configuration options. Determine if the defaults work for your use case, test, and adjust as needed.

# REL05-BP04 Fail fast and limit queues

When a service is unable to respond successfully to a request, fail fast. This allows resources associated with a request to be released, and permits a service to recover if it’s running out of resources. Failing fast is a well-established software design pattern that can be leveraged to build highly reliable workloads in the cloud. Queuing is also a well-established enterprise integration pattern that can smooth load and allow clients to release resources when asynchronous processing can be tolerated. When a service is able to respond successfully under normal conditions but fails when the rate of requests is too high, use a queue to buffer requests. However, do not allow a buildup of long queue backlogs that can result in processing stale requests that a client has already given up on.

**Desired outcome:** When systems experience resource contention, timeouts, exceptions, or grey failures that make service level objectives unachievable, fail fast strategies allow for faster system recovery. Systems that must absorb traffic spikes and can accommodate asynchronous processing can improve reliability by allowing clients to quickly release requests by using queues to buffer requests to backend services. When buffering requests to queues, queue management strategies are implemented to avoid insurmountable backlogs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing message queues but not configuring dead letter queues (DLQ) or alarms on DLQ volumes to detect when a system is in failure.
- Not measuring the age of messages in a queue, a measurement of latency to understand when queue consumers are falling behind or erroring out causing retrying.
- Not clearing backlogged messages from a queue, when there is no value in processing these messages if the business need no longer exists.
- Configuring first in first out (FIFO) queues when last in first out (LIFO) queues would better serve client needs, for example when strict ordering is not required and backlog processing is delaying all new and time sensitive requests resulting in all clients experiencing breached service levels.
- Exposing internal queues to clients instead of exposing APIs that manage work intake and place requests into internal queues.
- Combining too many work request types into a single queue which can exacerbate backlog conditions by spreading resource demand across request types.
- Processing complex and simple requests in the same queue, despite needing different monitoring, timeouts and resource allocations.
- Not validating inputs or using assertions to implement fail fast mechanisms in software that bubble up exceptions to higher level components that can handle errors gracefully.
- Not removing faulty resources from request routing, especially when failures are grey emitting both successes and failures due to crashing and restarting, intermittent dependency failure, reduced capacity, or network packet loss.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Systems that fail fast are easier to debug and fix, and often expose issues in coding and configuration before releases are published into production. Systems that incorporate effective queueing strategies provide greater resilience and reliability to traffic spikes and intermittent system fault conditions.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Fail fast strategies can be coded into software solutions as well as configured into infrastructure. In addition to failing fast, queues are a straightforward yet powerful architectural technique to decouple system components smooth load. [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) provides capabilities to monitor for and alarm on failures. Once a system is known to be failing, mitigation strategies can be invoked, including failing away from impaired resources. When systems implement queues with [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and other queue technologies to smooth load, they must consider how to manage queue backlogs, as well as message consumption failures.

## Implementation steps

- Implement programmatic assertions or specific metrics in your software and use them to explicitly alert on system issues. Amazon CloudWatch helps you create metrics and alarms based on application log pattern and SDK instrumentation.
- Use CloudWatch metrics and alarms to fail away from impaired resources that are adding latency to processing or repeatedly failing to process requests.
- Use asynchronous processing by designing APIs to accept requests and append requests to internal queues using Amazon SQS and then respond to the message-producing client with a success message so the client can release resources and move on with other work while backend queue consumers process requests.
- Measure and monitor for queue processing latency by producing a CloudWatch metric each time you take a message off a queue by comparing now to message timestamp.
- When failures prevent successful message processing or traffic spikes in volumes that cannot be processed within service level agreements, sideline older or excess traffic to a spillover queue. This allows priority processing of new work, and older work when capacity is available. This technique is an approximation of LIFO processing and allows normal system processing for all new work.
- Use dead letter or redrive queues to move messages that can’t be processed out of the backlog into a location that can be researched and resolved later
- Either retry or, when tolerable, drop old messages by comparing now to the message timestamp and discarding messages that are no longer relevant to the requesting client.

# REL05-BP05 Set client timeouts

Set timeouts appropriately on connections and requests, verify them systematically, and do not rely on default values as they are not aware of workload specifics.

**Desired outcome:** Client timeouts should consider the cost to the client, server, and workload associated with waiting for requests that take abnormal amounts of time to complete. Since it is not possible to know the exact cause of any timeout, clients must use knowledge of services to develop expectations of probable causes and appropriate timeouts

Client connections time out based on configured values. After encountering a timeout, clients make decisions to back off and retry or open a [circuit breaker](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html). These patterns avoid issuing requests that may exacerbate an underlying error condition.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not being aware of system timeouts or default timeouts.
- Not being aware of normal request completion timing.
- Not being aware of possible causes for requests to take abnormally long to complete, or the costs to client, service, or workload performance associated with waiting on these completions.
- Not being aware of the probability of impaired network causing a request to fail only once timeout is reached, and the costs to client and workload performance for not adopting a shorter timeout.
- Not testing timeout scenarios both for connections and requests.
- Setting timeouts too high, which can result in long wait times and increase resource utilization.
- Setting timeouts too low, resulting in artificial failures.
- Overlooking patterns to deal with timeout errors for remote calls like circuit breakers and retries.
- Not considering monitoring for service call error rates, service level objectives for latency, and latency outliers. These metrics can provide insight to aggressive or permissive timeouts

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Remote call timeouts are configured and systems are designed to handle timeouts gracefully so that resources are conserved when remote calls respond abnormally slow and timeout errors are handled gracefully by service clients.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Set both a connection timeout and a request timeout on any service dependency call and generally on any call across processes. Many frameworks offer built-in timeout capabilities, but be careful, as some have default values that are infinite or higher than acceptable for your service goals. A value that is too high reduces the usefulness of the timeout because resources continue to be consumed while the client waits for the timeout to occur. A value that is too low can generate increased traffic on the backend and increased latency because too many requests are retried. In some cases, this can lead to complete outages because all requests are being retried.

Consider the following when determining timeout strategies:

- Requests may take longer than normal to process because of their content, impairments in a target service, or a networking partition failure.
- Requests with abnormally expensive content could consume unnecessary server and client resources. In this case, timing out these requests and not retrying can preserve resources. Services should also protect themselves from abnormally expensive content with throttles and server-side timeouts.
- Requests that take abnormally long due to a service impairment can be timed out and retried. Consideration should be given to service costs for the request and retry, but if the cause is a localized impairment, a retry is not likely to be expensive and will reduce client resource consumption. The timeout may also release server resources depending on the nature of the impairment.
- Requests that take a long time to complete because the request or response has failed to be delivered by the network can be timed out and retried. Because the request or response was not delivered, failure would have been the outcome regardless of the length of timeout. Timing out in this case will not release server resources, but it will release client resources and improve workload performance.

Take advantage of well-established design patterns like retries and circuit breakers to handle timeouts gracefully and support fail-fast approaches. [AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html#sdks) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) allow for configuration of both connection and request timeouts and for retries with exponential backoff and jitter. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions support configuration of timeouts, and with [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), you can build low code circuit breakers that take advantage of pre-built integrations with AWS services and SDKs. [AWS App Mesh](https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/) Envoy provides timeout and circuit breaker capabilities.

## Implementation steps

- Configure timeouts on remote service calls and take advantage of built-in language timeout features or open source timeout libraries.
- When your workload makes calls with an AWS SDK, review the documentation for language specific timeout configuration.

- [C++](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/client-config.html)

- When using AWS SDKs or AWS CLI commands in your workload, configure default timeout values by setting the AWS [configuration defaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-smart-config-defaults.html) for `connectTimeoutInMillis` and `tlsNegotiationTimeoutInMillis`.
- Apply [command line options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html) `cli-connect-timeout` and `cli-read-timeout` to control one-off AWS CLI commands to AWS services.
- Monitor remote service calls for timeouts, and set alarms on persistent errors so that you can proactively handle error scenarios.
- Implement [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) and [CloudWatch anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Anomaly_Detection.html) on call error rates, service level objectives for latency, and latency outliers to provide insight into managing overly aggressive or permissive timeouts.
- Configure timeouts on [Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-timeout-console).
- API Gateway clients must implement their own retries when handling timeouts. API Gateway supports a [50 millisecond to 29 second integration timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html#api-gateway-execution-service-limits-table) for downstream integrations and does not retry when integration requests timeout.
- Implement the [circuit breaker](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html) pattern to avoid making remote calls when they are timing out. Open the circuit to avoid failing calls and close the circuit when calls are responding normally.
- For container based workloads, review [App Mesh Envoy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html) features to leverage built in timeouts and circuit breakers.
- Use AWS Step Functions to build low code circuit breakers for remote service calls, especially where calling AWS native SDKs and supported Step Functions integrations to simplify your workload.

# REL05-BP06 Make systems stateless where possible

Systems should either not require state, or should offload state
such that between different client requests, there is no dependence
on locally stored data on disk and in memory. This allows servers to
be replaced at will without causing an availability impact.

When users or services interact with an application, they often
perform a series of interactions that form a session. A session is
unique data for users that persists between requests while they use
the application. A stateless application is an application that does
not need knowledge of previous interactions and does not store
session information.

Once designed to be stateless, you can then use serverless compute
services, such as AWS Lambda or AWS Fargate.

In addition to server replacement, another benefit of stateless
applications is that they can scale horizontally because any of the
available compute resources (such as EC2 instances and AWS Lambda
functions) can service any request.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Systems that are designed to be stateless are
more adaptable to horizontal scaling, making it possible to add or
remove capacity based on fluctuating traffic and demand. They are
also inherently resilient to failures and provide flexibility and
agility in application development.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Make your applications stateless. Stateless applications allow
horizontal scaling and are tolerant to the failure of an
individual node. Analyze and understand the components of your
application that maintain state within the architecture. This
helps you assess the potential impact of transitioning to a
stateless design. A stateless architecture decouples user data and
offloads the session data. This provides the flexibility to scale
each component independently to meet varying workload demands and
optimize resource utilization.

### Implementation steps

- Identify and understand the stateful components in your
application.
- Decouple data by separating and managing user data from the
core application logic.

[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) can decouple user data from application
code by using features, such as
[identity
pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-identity-pools.html),
[user
pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html), and
[Amazon Cognito Sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sync.html).
- You can use
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) decouple user data by storing
secrets in a secure, centralized location. This means
that the application code doesn't need to store secrets,
which makes it more secure.
- Consider using
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store large, unstructured data, such as
images and documents. Your application can retrieve this
data when required, eliminating the need to store it in
memory.
- Use
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to store information such as user
profiles. Your application can query this data in
near-real time.

- Offload session data to a database, cache, or external
files.

[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), Amazon DynamoDB,
[Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (Amazon EFS), and
[Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/) are examples of AWS services
that you can use to offload session data.

- Design a stateless architecture after you identify which
state and user data need to be persisted with your storage
solution of choice.

# REL05-BP07 Implement emergency levers

Emergency levers are rapid processes that can mitigate availability
impact on your workload.

Emergency levers work by disabling, throttling, or changing the behavior of components or dependencies using known and tested mechanisms. This can alleviate workload impairments caused by resource exhaustion due to unexpected increases in demand and reduce the impact of failures in non-critical components within your workload.

**Desired outcome:** By implementing emergency levers, you can establish known-good processes to maintain the availability of critical components in your workload. The workload should degrade gracefully and continue to perform its business-critical functions during the activation of an emergency lever. For more detail on graceful degradation, see [REL05-BP01 Implement graceful degradation to transform applicable hard dependencies into soft dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation.html).

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Failure of non-critical dependencies impacts the availability of your core workload.
- Not testing or verifying critical component behavior during non-critical component impairment.
- No clear and deterministic criteria defined for activation or deactivation of an emergency lever.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Implementing emergency levers can improve the availability of the critical components in your workload by providing your resolvers with established processes to respond to unexpected spikes in demand or failures of non-critical dependencies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- Identify critical components in your workload.
- Design and architect the critical components in your workload to withstand failure of non-critical components.
- Conduct testing to validate the behavior of your critical components during the failure of non-critical components.
- Define and monitor relevant metrics or triggers to initiate emergency lever procedures.
- Define the procedures (manual or automated) that comprise the emergency lever.

### Implementation steps

- Identify business-critical components in your workload.

Each technical component in your workload should be mapped to its relevant business function and ranked as critical or non-critical. For examples of critical and non-critical functionality at Amazon, see [Any Day Can Be Prime Day: How Amazon.com Search Uses Chaos Engineering to Handle Over 84K Requests Per Second](https://community.aws/posts/how-search-uses-chaos-engineering).
- This is both a technical and business decision, and varies by organization and workload.

- Design and architect the critical components in your workload to withstand failure of non-critical components.

During dependency analysis, consider all potential failure modes, and verify that your emergency lever mechanisms deliver the critical functionality to downstream components.

- Conduct testing to validate the behavior of your critical components during activation of your emergency levers.

Avoid bimodal behavior. For more detail, see [REL11-BP05 Use static stability to prevent bimodal behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_withstand_component_failures_static_stability.html).

- Define, monitor, and alert on relevant metrics to initiate the emergency lever procedure.

Finding the right metrics to monitor depends on your workload. Some example metrics are latency or the number of failed request to a dependency.

- Define the procedures, manual or automated, that comprise the emergency lever.

This may include mechanisms such as [load shedding](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/), [throttling requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_throttle_requests.html), or implementing [graceful degradation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation.html).

## Question REL06

# REL 6 — How do you monitor workload resources?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 7

---

# REL06-BP01 Monitor all components for the workload (Generation)

Monitor the components of the workload with Amazon CloudWatch or
third-party tools. Monitor AWS services with AWS Health Dashboard.

All components of your workload should be monitored, including the
front-end, business logic, and storage tiers. Define key metrics,
describe how to extract them from logs (if necessary), and set
thresholds for invoking corresponding alarm events. Ensure metrics
are relevant to the key performance indicators (KPIs) of your
workload, and use metrics and logs to identify early warning signs
of service degradation. For example, a metric related to business
outcomes such as the number of orders successfully processed per
minute, can indicate workload issues faster than technical metric,
such as CPU Utilization. Use AWS Health Dashboard for a personalized
view into the performance and availability of the AWS services
underlying your AWS resources.

Monitoring in the cloud offers new opportunities. Most cloud
providers have developed customizable hooks and can deliver insights
to help you monitor multiple layers of your workload. AWS services
such as Amazon CloudWatch apply statistical and machine learning
algorithms to continually analyze metrics of systems and
applications, determine normal baselines, and surface anomalies with
minimal user intervention. Anomaly detection algorithms account for
the seasonality and trend changes of metrics.

AWS makes an abundance of monitoring and log information available
for consumption that can be used to define workload-specific
metrics, change-in-demand processes, and adopt machine learning
techniques regardless of ML expertise.

In addition, monitor all of your external endpoints to ensure that
they are independent of your base implementation. This active
monitoring can be done with synthetic transactions (sometimes
referred to as *user canaries*, but not to be
confused with canary deployments) which periodically run a number of
common tasks matching actions performed by clients of the workload.
Keep these tasks short in duration and be sure not to overload your
workload during testing. Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allows you
to [create
synthetic canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) to monitor your endpoints and APIs. You
can also combine the synthetic canary client nodes with AWS X-Ray
console to pinpoint which synthetic canaries are experiencing issues
with errors, faults, or throttling rates for the selected time
frame.

**Desired Outcome:**

Collect and use critical metrics from all components of the workload
to ensure workload reliability and optimal user experience.
Detecting that a workload is not achieving business outcomes allows
you to quickly declare a disaster and recover from an incident.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Only monitoring external interfaces to your workload.
- Not generating any workload-specific metrics and only relying on
metrics provided to you by the AWS services your workload uses.
- Only using technical metrics in your workload and not monitoring
any metrics related to non-technical KPIs the workload
contributes to.
- Relying on production traffic and simple health checks to
monitor and evaluate workload state.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Monitoring at all tiers in your workload
allows you to more rapidly anticipate and resolve problems in the
components that comprise the workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- **Turn on logging where
available.** Monitoring data should be obtained from
all components of the workloads. Turn on additional logging,
such as S3 Access Logs, and permit your workload to log
workload specific data. Collect metrics for CPU, network I/O,
and disk I/O averages from services such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Auto Scaling, and
Amazon EMR. See
[AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html) for a list of
AWS services that publish metrics to CloudWatch.
- **Review all default metrics and explore
any data collection gaps.** Every service generates
default metrics. Collecting default metrics allows you to
better understand the dependencies between workload
components, and how component reliability and performance
affect the workload. You can also create and
[publish
your own metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an
API.
- **Evaluate all the metrics to decide
which ones to alert on for each AWS service in your
workload.** You may choose to select a subset of
metrics that have a major impact on workload reliability.
Focusing on critical metrics and threshold allows you to
refine the number of
[alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)
and can help minimize false-positives.
- **Define alerts and the recovery process
for your workload after the alert is invoked.**
Defining alerts allows you to quickly notify, escalate, and
follow steps necessary to recover from an incident and meet
your prescribed Recovery Time Objective (RTO). You can use
[Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-actions) to invoke automated
workflows and initiate recovery procedures based on defined
thresholds.
- **Explore use of synthetic transactions
to collect relevant data about workloads state.**
Synthetic monitoring follows the same routes and perform the
same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to
continually verify your customer experience even when you
don't have any customer traffic on your workloads. By using
[synthetic
transactions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html), you can discover issues before your
customers do.

# REL06-BP02 Define and calculate metrics (Aggregation)

Collect metrics and logs from your workload components and calculate
relevant aggregate metrics from them. These metrics provide broad
and deep observability of your workload and can significantly
improve your resilience posture.

Observability is more than just collecting metrics from workload
components and being able to view and alert on them. It's about
having a holistic understanding about your workload's behavior. This
behavioral information comes from all components in your workloads,
which includes the cloud services on which they depend, well-crafted
logs, and metrics. This data gives you oversight on your workload's
behavior as a whole, as well as an understanding of every
component's interaction with every unit of work at a fine level of
detail.

**Desired outcome:**

- You collect logs from your workload components and AWS service
dependencies, and you publish them to a central location where
they can be easily accessed and processed.
- Your logs contain high-fidelity and accurate timestamps.
- Your logs contain relevant information about the processing
context, such as a trace identifier, user or account identifier,
and remote IP address.
- You create aggregate metrics from your logs that represent your
workload's behavior from a high-level perspective.
- You are able to query your aggregated logs to gain deep and
relevant insights about your workload and identify actual and
potential problems.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You don't collect relevant logs or metrics from the compute
instances your workloads run on or the cloud services they use.
- You overlook the collection of logs and metrics related to your
business key performance indicators (KPIs).
- You analyze workload-related telemetry in isolation without
aggregation and correlation.
- You allow metrics and logs to expire too quickly, which hinders
trend analysis and recurring issue identification.

**Benefits of establishing these best
practices:** You can detect more anomalies and correlate
events and metrics between different components of your workload.
You can create insights from your workload components based on
information contained in logs that frequently aren't available in
metrics alone. You can determine causes of failure more quickly by
querying your logs at scale.

**Level of risk exposed if these best
practices are not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Identify the sources of telemetry data that are relevant for your
workloads and their components. This data comes not only from
components that publish metrics, such as your operating system
(OS) and application runtimes such as Java, but also from
application and cloud service logs. For example, web servers
typically log each request with detailed information such as the
timestamp, processing latency, user ID, remote IP address, path,
and query string. The level of detail in these logs helps you
perform detailed queries and generate metrics that may not have
been otherwise available.

Collect the metrics and logs using appropriate tools and
processes. Logs generated by applications running on Amazon EC2
instance can be collected by an agent such as the
[Amazon CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) and published to a central storage service
such as
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html). AWS-managed compute services such as
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) publish logs to CloudWatch Logs for you
automatically. Enable log collection for AWS storage and
processing services used by your workloads such as
[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/),
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), and
[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

Enrich your telemetry data with
*[dimensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension)*
that can help you see behavioral patterns more clearly and isolate
correlated problems to groups of related components. Once added,
you can observe component behavior at a finer level of detail,
detect correlated failures, and take appropriate remedial steps.
Examples of useful dimensions include Availability Zone, EC2
instance ID, and container task or Pod ID.

Once you have collected the metrics and logs, you can write
queries and generate aggregate metrics from them that provide
useful insights into both normal and anomalous behavior. For
example, you can use
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) to derive custom metrics from your
application logs,
[Amazon CloudWatch Metrics Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/query_with_cloudwatch-metrics-insights.html) to query your metrics at scale,
[Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) to collect, aggregate and
summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications
and microservices, or
[Amazon CloudWatch Lambda Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights.html) if you're using AWS Lambda
functions. To create an aggregate error rate metric, you can
increment a counter each time an error response or message is
found in your component logs or calculate the aggregate value of
an existing error rate metric. You can use this data to generate
histograms that show *tail behavior*, such as
the worst-performing requests or processes. You can also scan this
data in real time for anomalous patterns using solutions such as
CloudWatch Logs
[anomaly
detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/LogsAnomalyDetection.html). These insights can be placed on dashboards to
keep them organized according to your needs and preferences.

Querying logs can help you understand how specific requests were
handled by your workload components and reveal request patterns or
other context that has an impact on your workload's resilience. It
can be useful to research and prepare queries in advance, based on
your knowledge of how your applications and other components
behave, so you can more easily run them as needed. For example,
with
[CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html), you can interactively search and analyze
your log data stored in CloudWatch Logs. You can also use
[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to query logs from multiple sources, including
[many
AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-aws-service-logs.html), at petabyte scale.

When you define a log retention policy, consider the value of
historical logs. Historical logs can help identify long-term usage
and behavioral patterns, regressions, and improvements in your
workload's performance. Permanently deleted logs cannot be
analyzed later. However, the value of historical logs tends to
diminish over long periods of time. Choose a policy that balances
your needs as appropriate and is compliant with any legal or
contractual requirements you might be subject to.

### Implementation steps

- Choose collection, storage, analysis, and display mechanisms
for your observability data.
- Install and configure metric and log collectors on the
appropriate components of your workload (for example, on
Amazon EC2 instances and in
[sidecar
containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)). Configure these collectors to restart
automatically if they unexpectedly stop. Enable disk or
memory buffering for the collectors so that temporary
publication failures don't impact your applications or
result in lost data.
- Enable logging on AWS services you use as a part of your
workloads, and forward those logs to the storage service you
selected if needed. Refer to the respective services' user
or developer guides for detailed instructions.
- Define the operational metrics relevant to your workloads
that are based on your telemetry data. These could be based
on direct metrics emitted from your workload components,
which can include business KPI related metrics, or the
results of aggregated calculations such as sums, rates,
percentiles, or histograms. Calculate these metrics using
your log analyzer, and place them on dashboards as
appropriate.
- Prepare appropriate log queries to analyze workload
components, requests, or transaction behavior as needed.
- Define and enable a log retention policy for your component
logs. Periodically delete logs when they become older than
the policy permits.

# REL06-BP03 Send notifications (Real-time processing and alarming)

When organizations detect potential issues, they send real-time notifications and alerts to the appropriate personnel and systems in order to respond quickly and effectively to these issues.

**Desired outcome:** Rapid responses to operational events are possible through configuration of relevant alarms based on service and application metrics. When alarm thresholds are breached, the appropriate personnel and systems are notified so they can address underlying issues.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Configuring alarms with an excessively high threshold, resulting in the failure to send vital notifications.
- Configuring alarms with a threshold that is too low, resulting in inaction on important alerts due to the noise of excessive notifications.
- Not updating alarms and their threshold when usage changes.
- For alarms best addressed through automated actions, sending the notification to personnel instead of generating the automated action results in excessive notifications being sent.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Sending real-time notifications and alerts to the appropriate personnel and systems allows for early detection of issues and rapid responses to operational incidents.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Workloads should be equipped with real-time processing and alarming to improve the detectability of issues that could impact the availability of the application and serve as triggers for automated response. Organizations can perform real-time processing and alarming by creating alerts with defined metrics in order to receive notifications whenever significant events occur or a metric exceeds a threshold.

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) allows you to create [metric](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) and composite alarms using CloudWatch alarms based on static threshold, anomaly detection, and other criteria. For more detail on the types of alarms you can configure using CloudWatch, see the [alarms section of the CloudWatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html).

You can construct customized views of metrics and alerts of your AWS resources for your teams using [CloudWatch dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html). The customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console allow you to monitor your resources in a single view across multiple Regions.

Alarms can perform one or more actions, like sending a notification to an [Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SetupSNS.html), performing an [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) action or an [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) action, or [creating an OpsItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html) or [incident](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html) in AWS Systems Manager.

Amazon CloudWatch uses [Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) to send notifications when the alarm changes state, providing message delivery from the publishers (producers) to the subscribers (consumers).
For more detail on setting up Amazon SNS notifications, see [Configuring Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-configuring.html).

CloudWatch sends [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-and-eventbridge.html) whenever a CloudWatch alarm is created, updated, deleted, or its state changes. You can use EventBridge with these events to create rules that perform actions, such as notifying you whenever the state of an alarm changes or
automatically triggering events in your account using [Systems Manager automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html).

Stay informed with [AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/). AWS Health is the authoritative source of information about the health of your AWS Cloud resources. Use AWS Health to get notified of any confirmed service events so you can quickly take steps to mitigate any impact. Create purpose-fit AWS Health event notifications to e-mail and chat channels through [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html) and integrate programmatically with [your monitoring and alerting tools through Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html). If you use AWS Organizations, aggregate AWS Health events across accounts.

**When should you use EventBridge or Amazon SNS?**

Both EventBridge and Amazon SNS can be used to develop event-driven applications, and your choice will depend on your specific needs.

Amazon EventBridge is recommended when you want to build an application that reacts to events from your own applications, SaaS applications, and AWS services. EventBridge is the only event-based service that integrates directly with third-party SaaS partners. EventBridge also automatically ingests events from over 200 AWS services without requiring developers to create any resources in their account.

EventBridge uses a defined JSON-based structure for events, and helps you create rules that are applied across the entire event body to select events to forward to a [target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html). EventBridge currently supports over 20 AWS services as targets, including [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html), [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), Amazon SNS, [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/), and [Amazon Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/).

Amazon SNS is recommended for applications that need high fan out (thousands or millions of endpoints). A common pattern we see is that customers use Amazon SNS as a target for their rule to filter the events that they need, and fan out to multiple endpoints.

Messages are unstructured and can be in any format. Amazon SNS supports forwarding messages to six different types of targets, including Lambda, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S endpoints, SMS, mobile push, and email. Amazon SNS [typical latency is under 30 milliseconds](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/faqs/). A wide range of AWS services send Amazon SNS messages by configuring the service to do so (more than 30, including Amazon EC2, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)).

### Implementation steps

- Create an alarm using [Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html).

A metric alarm monitors a single CloudWatch metric or an expression dependent on CloudWatch metrics. The alarm initiates one or more actions based on the value of the metric or expression in comparison to a threshold over a number of time intervals. The action may consist of sending a notification to an [Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SetupSNS.html), performing an [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) action or an [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) action, or [creating an OpsItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html) or [incident](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html) in AWS Systems Manager.
- A composite alarm consists of a rule expression that considers the alarm conditions of other alarms you've created. The composite alarm only enters alarm state if all rule conditions are met. The alarms specified in the rule expression of a composite alarm can include metric alarms and additional composite alarms. Composite alarms can send Amazon SNS notifications when their state changes and can create Systems Manager [OpsItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html) or [incidents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html) when they enter the alarm state, but they cannot perform Amazon EC2 or Auto Scaling actions.

- Set up [Amazon SNS notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SetupSNS.html). When creating a CloudWatch alarm, you can include an Amazon SNS topic to send a notification when the alarm changes state.
- [Create rules in EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-get-started.html) that matches specified CloudWatch alarms. Each rule supports multiple targets, including Lambda functions. For example, you can define an alarm that initiates when available disk space is running low, which triggers a Lambda function through an EventBridge rule, to clean up the space. For more detail on EventBridge targets, see [EventBridge targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html).

# REL06-BP04 Automate responses (Real-time processing and alarming)

Use automation to take action when an event is detected, for
example, to replace failed components.

Automated real-time processing of alarms is implemented so that systems can take quick corrective action and attempt to prevent failures or degraded service when alarms are triggered. Automated responses to alarms could include the replacement of failing components, the adjustment of compute capacity, the redirection of traffic to healthy hosts, availability zones, or other regions, and the notification of operators.

**Desired outcome:** Real-time alarms are identified, and automated processing of alarms is set up to invoke the appropriate actions taken to maintain service level objectives and service-level agreements (SLAs). Automation can range from self-healing activities of single components to full-site failover.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not having a clear inventory or catalog of key real-time alarms.
- No automated responses on critical alarms (for example, when compute is nearing exhaustion, autoscaling occurs).
- Contradictory alarm response actions.
- No standard operating procedures (SOPs) for operators to follow when they receive alert notifications.
- Not monitoring configuration changes, as undetected configuration changes can cause downtime for workloads.
- Not having a strategy to undo unintended configuration changes.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Automating alarm processing can improve system resiliency. The system takes corrective actions automatically, reducing manual activities that allow for human, error-prone interventions. Workload operates meet availability goals, and reduces service disruption.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To effectively manage alerts and automate their response, categorize alerts based on their criticality and impact, document response procedures, and plan responses before ranking tasks.

Identify tasks requiring specific actions (often detailed in runbooks), and examine all runbooks and playbooks to determine which tasks can be automated. If actions can be defined, often they can be automated. If actions cannot be automated, document manual steps in an SOP and train operators on them. Continually challenge manual processes for automation opportunities where you can establish and maintain a plan to automate alert responses.

### Implementation steps

- **Create an inventory of alarms:** To obtain a list of all alarms, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) command `[describe-alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/describe-alarms.html)`. Depending upon how many alarms you have set up, you might have to use pagination to retrieve a subset of alarms for each call, or alternatively you can use the AWS SDK to obtain the alarms [using an API call](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/cw-example-describing-alarms.html).
- **Document all alarm actions:** Update a runbook with all alarms and their actions, irrespective if they are manual or automated. [AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) provides predefined runbooks. For more information about runbooks, see [Working with runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.html). For detail on how to view runbook content, see [View runbook content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-runbook-reference.html#view-automation-json).
- **Set up and manage alarm actions:** For any of the alarms that require an action, specify the [automated action using the CloudWatch SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/cw-example-using-alarm-actions.html). For example, you can change the state of your Amazon EC2 instances automatically based on a CloudWatch alarm by creating and enabling actions on an alarm or disabling actions on an alarm.

You can also use [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) to respond automatically to system events, such as application availability issues or resource changes. You can create rules to indicate which events you're interested in, and the actions to take when an event matches a rule. The actions that can be automatically initiated include invoking an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function, invoking [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) `Run Command`, relaying the event to [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/), and seeing [Automate Amazon EC2 using EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/automating_with_eventbridge.html).
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Based on your application components, [AWS Resilience Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/what-is.html) recommends multiple [SOP templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/sops.html). You can use these SOPs to document all the processes an operator should follow in case an alert is raised. You can also [construct a SOP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/building-sops.html) based on Resilience Hub recommendations, where you need an Resilience Hub application with an associated resiliency policy, as well as a historic resiliency assessment against that application. The recommendations for your SOP are produced by the resiliency assessment.

Resilience Hub works with Systems Manager to automate the steps of your SOPs by providing a number of [SSM documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/create-custom-ssm-doc.html) you can use as the basis for those SOPs. For example, Resilience Hub may recommend an SOP for adding disk space based on an existing SSM automation document.
- **Perform automated actions using Amazon DevOps Guru:**
You can use [Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/) to automatically monitor application resources for anomalous behavior and deliver targeted recommendations to speed up problem identification and remediation times. With DevOps Guru, you can monitor streams of operational data in near real time from multiple sources including Amazon CloudWatch metrics, [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/), [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), and [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/). You can also use DevOps Guru to automatically create [OpsItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html) in OpsCenter and send events to [EventBridge for additional automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-eventbridge.html).

# REL06-BP05 Analyze logs

Collect log files and metrics histories and analyze these for
broader trends and workload insights.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights supports
a [simple
yet powerful query language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html) that you can use to analyze log
data. Amazon CloudWatch Logs also supports subscriptions that allow
data to flow seamlessly to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data. It also supports queries on a large array
of formats.
See [Supported
SerDes and Data Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/supported-format.html) in the Amazon Athena User Guide for
more information. For analysis of huge log file sets, you can run an
Amazon EMR cluster to run petabyte-scale analyses.

There are a number of tools provided by AWS Partners and third
parties that allow for aggregation, processing, storage, and
analytics. These tools include New Relic, Splunk, Loggly, Logstash,
CloudHealth, and Nagios. However, outside generation of system and
application logs is unique to each cloud provider, and often unique
to each service.

An often-overlooked part of the monitoring process is data
management. You need to determine the retention requirements for
monitoring data, and then apply lifecycle policies accordingly.
Amazon S3 supports lifecycle management at the S3 bucket level. This
lifecycle management can be applied differently to different paths
in the bucket. Toward the end of the lifecycle, you can transition
data to Amazon Glacier for long-term storage, and then expiration
after the end of the retention period is reached. The S3
Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by
automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier,
without performance impact or operational overhead.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to interactively search and
analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

[Analyzing Log Data

[How
do I analyze my Amazon S3 server access logs using Athena?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/analyze-logs-athena/)

Create an S3 lifecycle policy for your server access logs bucket. Configure
the lifecycle policy to periodically remove log files. Doing so reduces the amount
of data that Athena analyzes for each query.

# REL06-BP06 Regularly review monitoring scope and metrics

Frequently review how workload monitoring is implemented, and update
it as your workload and its architecture evolves. Regular audits of
your monitoring helps reduce the risk of missed or overlooked
trouble indicators and further helps your workload meet its
availability goals.

Effective monitoring is anchored in key business metrics, which
evolve as your business priorities change. Your monitoring review
process should emphasize service-level indicators (SLIs) and
incorporate insights from your infrastructure, applications,
clients, and users.

**Desired outcome:** You have an
effective monitoring strategy that is regularly reviewed and updated
periodically, as well as after any significant events or changes.
You verify that key application health indicators are still relevant
as your workload and business requirements evolve.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You collect only default metrics.
- You set up a monitoring strategy, but you never review it.
- You don't discuss monitoring when major changes are deployed.
- You trust outdated metrics to determine workload health.
- Your operations teams are overwhelmed with false-positive alerts
due to outdated metrics and thresholds.
- You lack observability of application components that are not
being monitored.
- You focus only on low-level technical metrics and excluding
business metrics in your monitoring.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When you regularly review your monitoring, you
can anticipate potential problems and verify that you are capable of
detecting them. It also allows you to uncover blind spots that you
might have missed during earlier reviews, which further improves
your ability to detect issues.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Review monitoring metrics and scope during your
[operational
readiness review (ORR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/wa-operational-readiness-reviews.html) process. Perform periodic
operational readiness reviews on a consistent schedule to evaluate
whether there are any gaps between your current workload and the
monitoring you have configured. Establish a regular cadence for
operational performance reviews and knowledge sharing to enhance
your ability to achieve higher performance from your operational
teams. Validate whether existing alert thresholds are still
adequate, and check for situations where operational teams are
receiving false-positive alerts or not monitoring aspects of the
application that should be monitored.

The
[Resilience
Analysis Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/resilience-analysis-framework/introduction.html) provides useful guidance that can help
you navigate the process. The focus of the framework is to
identify potential failure modes and the preventive and corrective
controls you can use to mitigate their impact. This knowledge can
help you identify the right metrics and events to monitor and
alert upon.

### Implementation steps

- Schedule and conduct regular reviews of the workload
dashboards. You may have different cadences for the depth at
which you inspect.
- Inspect for trends in the metrics. Compare the metric values to historic values to see if there are trends that may indicate that something that needs investigation. Examples of this include increased latency, decreased primary business function, and increased failure responses.
- Inspect for outliers and anomalies in your metrics, which can be masked by averages or medians. Look at the highest and lowest values during the time frame, and investigate the causes of observations that are far outside of normal bounds. As you continue to remove these causes, you can tighten your expected metric bounds in response to the improved consistency of your workload performance.
- Look for sharp changes in behavior. An immediate change in quantity or direction of a metric may indicate that there has been a change in the application or external factors that you may need to add additional metrics to track.
- Review whether the current monitoring strategy remains relevant for the application. Based on an analysis of previous incidents (or the Resilience Analysis Framework), assess if there are additional aspects of the application that should be incorporated into the monitoring scope.
- Review your Real User Monitoring (RUM) metrics to determine whether there are any gaps in application functionality coverage.
- Review your change management process. Update your
procedures if necessary to include a monitoring analysis
step that should be performed before you approve a change.
- Implement monitoring review as part of your operational
readiness review and correction of error processes.

# REL06-BP07 Monitor end-to-end tracing of requests through your system

Trace requests as they process through service components so product teams can more easily analyze and debug issues and improve performance.

**Desired outcome:** Workloads with comprehensive tracing across all components are easy to debug, improving [mean time to resolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/availability-and-beyond-improving-resilience/reducing-mttr.html) (MTTR) of errors and latency by simplifying root cause discovery. End-to-end tracing reduces the time it takes to discover impacted components and drill into the detailed root causes of errors or latency.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Tracing is used for some components but not for all. For example, without tracing for AWS Lambda, teams might not clearly understand latency caused by cold starts in a spiky workload.
- Synthetic canaries or real-user monitoring (RUM) are not configured with tracing. Without canaries or RUM, client interaction telemetry is omitted from the trace analysis yielding an incomplete performance profile.
- Hybrid workloads include both cloud native and third party tracing tools, but steps have not been taken elect and fully integrate a single tracing solution. Based on the elected tracing solution, cloud native tracing SDKs should be used to instrument components that are not cloud native or third party tools should be configured to ingest cloud native trace telemetry.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** When development teams are alerted to issues, they can see a full picture of system component interactions, including component by component correlation to logging, performance, and failures. Because tracing makes it easy to visually identify root causes, less time is spent investigating root causes. Teams that understand component interactions in detail make better and faster decisions when resolving issues. Decisions like when to invoke disaster recovery (DR) failover or where to best implement self-healing strategies can be improved by analyzing systems traces, ultimately improving customer satisfaction with your services.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Teams that operate distributed applications can use tracing tools to establish a correlation identifier, collect traces of requests, and build service maps of connected components. All application components should be included in request traces including service clients, middleware gateways and event buses, compute components, and storage, including key value stores and databases. Include synthetic canaries and real-user monitoring in your end-to-end tracing configuration to measure remote client interactions and latency so that you can accurately evaluate your systems performance against your service level agreements and objectives.

You can use [AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html) and [Amazon CloudWatch Application Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Monitoring-Sections.html) instrumentation services to provide a complete view of requests as they travel through your application. X-Ray collects application telemetry and allows you to visualize and filter it across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs, and can be turned on for system components with no-code or low-code. CloudWatch application monitoring includes ServiceLens to integrate your traces with metrics, logs, and alarms. CloudWatch application monitoring also includes synthetics to monitor your endpoints and APIs, as well as real-user monitoring to instrument your web application clients.

## Implementation steps

- Use AWS X-Ray on all supported native services like [Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-services.html). These AWS services enable X-Ray with configuration toggles using infrastructure as code, AWS SDKs, or the AWS Management Console.
- Instrument applications [AWS Distro for Open Telemetry and X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-services-adot.html) or third-party collection agents.
- Review the [AWS X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html) for programming language specific implementation. These documentation sections detail how to instrument HTTP requests, SQL queries, and other processes specific to your application programming language.
- Use X-Ray tracing for [Amazon CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) and [Amazon CloudWatch RUM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) to analyze the request path from your end user client through your downstream AWS infrastructure.
- Configure CloudWatch metrics and alarms based on resource health and canary telemetry so that teams are alerted to issues quickly, and can then deep dive into traces and service maps with ServiceLens.
- Enable X-Ray integration for third party tracing tools like [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/guide/serverless_enable_aws_xray/), [New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-x-ray-monitoring-integration/), or [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/amazon-web-services/amazon-web-services-integrations/aws-service-metrics) if you are using third party tools for your primary tracing solution.

## Question REL07

# REL 7 — How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# REL07-BP01 Use automation when obtaining or scaling resources

A cornerstone of reliability in the cloud is the programmatic
definition, provisioning, and management of your infrastructure and
resources. Automation helps you streamline resource provisioning,
facilitate consistent and secure deployments, and scale resources
across your entire infrastructure.

**Desired outcome**: You manage your
infrastructure as code (IaC). You define and maintain your
infrastructure code in version control systems (VCS). You delegate
provisioning AWS resources to automated mechanisms and leverage
managed services like Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load
Balancer (NLB), and Auto Scaling groups. You provision your
resources using continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)
pipelines so that code changes automatically initiate resource
updates, including updates to your Auto Scaling configurations.

**Common anti-patterns**:

- You deploy resources manually using the command line or at the
AWS Management Console (also known as *click-ops*).
- You tightly couple your application components or resources, and
create inflexible architectures as a result.
- You implement inflexible scaling policies that do not adapt to
changing business requirements, traffic patterns, or new
resource types.
- You manually estimate capacity to meet anticipated demand.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) allows
infrastructure to be defined programmatically. This helps you manage
infrastructure changes through the same software development
lifecycle as application changes, which promotes consistency and
repeatability and reduces the risk of manual, error-prone tasks. You
can further streamline the process of provisioning and updating
resources through implementing IaC with automated delivery
pipelines. You can deploy infrastructure updates reliably and
efficiently without the need for manual intervention. This agility
is particularly important when scaling resources to meet fluctuating
demands.

You can achieve dynamic, automated resource scaling in conjunction
with IaC and delivery pipelines. By monitoring key metrics and
applying predefined scaling policies, Auto Scaling can automatically
provision or deprovision resources as needed, which improves
performance and cost-efficiency. This reduces the potential for
manual errors or delays in response to changes in application or
workload requirements.

The combination of IaC, automated delivery pipelines, and Auto
Scaling helps organizations provision, update, and scale their
environments with confidence. This automation is essential to
maintain a responsive, resilient, and efficiently-managed cloud
infrastructure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To set up automation with CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as
code (IaC) for your AWS architecture, choose a version control
system such as Git to store your IaC templates and configuration.
These templates can be written using tools such as
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). To start, define your infrastructure
components (such as AWS VPCs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, and
Amazon RDS databases) within these templates.

Next, integrate these IaC templates with a CI/CD pipeline to
automate the deployment process.
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) provides a seamless AWS-native solution, or
you can use other third-party CI/CD solutions. Create a pipeline
that activates when changes occur to your version control
repository. Configure the pipeline to include stages that lint and
validate your IaC templates, deploy the infrastructure to a
staging environment, run automated tests, and finally, deploy to
production. Incorporate approval steps where necessary to maintain
control over changes. This automated pipeline not only speeds up
deployment but also facilitates consistency and reliability across
environments.

Configure Auto Scaling of resources such as Amazon EC2 instances,
Amazon ECS tasks, and database replicas in your IaC to provide
automatic scale-out and scale-in as needed. This approach enhances
application availability and performance and optimizes cost by
dynamically adjusting resources based on demand. For a list of
supported resources, see
[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) and
[AWS Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/what-is-application-auto-scaling.html).

### Implementation steps

- Create and use a source code repository to store the code
that controls your infrastructure configuration. Commit
changes to this repository to reflect any ongoing changes
you want to make.
- Select an infrastructure as code solution such as AWS CloudFormation to keep your infrastructure up to date and
detect inconsistency (drift) from your intended state.
- Integrate your IaC platform with your CI/CD pipeline to
automate deployments.
- Determine and collect the appropriate metrics for automatic
scaling of resources.
- Configure automatic scaling of resources using scale-out and
scale-in policies appropriate for your workload components.
Consider using scheduled scaling for predictable usage
patterns.
- Monitor deployments to detect failures and regressions.
Implement rollback mechanisms within your CI/CD platform to
revert changes if necessary.

# REL07-BP02 Obtain resources upon detection of impairment to a workload

Scale resources reactively when necessary if availability is
impacted, to restore workload availability.

You first must configure health checks and the criteria on these
checks to indicate when availability is impacted by lack of
resources. Then, either notify the appropriate personnel to manually
scale the resource, or start automation to automatically scale it.

Scale can be manually adjusted for your workload (for example,
changing the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, or
modifying throughput of a DynamoDB table through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI). However, automation should be used
whenever possible (refer to **Use automation
when obtaining or scaling resources**).

**Desired outcome:** Scaling activities (either automatically or manually) are initiated to restore availability upon detection of a failure or degraded customer experience.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Implement observability and monitoring across all components in your workload, to monitor customer experience and detect failure. Define the procedures, manual or automated, that scale the required resources. o For more information, see [REL11-BP01 Monitor all components of the workload to detect failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_withstand_component_failures_monitoring_health.html).

### Implementation steps

- Define the procedures, manual or automated, that scale the required resources.

Scaling procedures depend on how the different components within your workload are designed.
- Scaling procedures also vary depending on the underlying technology utilized.

Components using AWS Auto Scaling can use scaling plans to configure a set of instructions for scaling your resources. If you work with AWS CloudFormation or add tags to AWS resources, you can set up scaling plans for different sets of resources per application. Auto Scaling provides recommendations for scaling strategies customized to each resource. After you create your scaling plan, Auto Scaling combines dynamic scaling and predictive scaling methods together to support your scaling strategy. For more detail, see [How scaling plans work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/plans/userguide/how-it-works.html).
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling verifies that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum and maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below or above these limits. For more detail, see [What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html)
- Amazon DynamoDB auto scaling uses the Application Auto Scaling service to dynamically adjust provisioned throughput capacity on your behalf, in response to actual traffic patterns. This allows a table or a global secondary index to increase its provisioned read and write capacity to handle sudden increases in traffic, without throttling. For more detail, see [Managing throughput capacity automatically with DynamoDB auto scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.html).

# REL07-BP03 Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload

One of the most valuable features of cloud computing is the ability
to provision resources dynamically.

In traditional on-premises compute environments, you must identify
and provision enough capacity in advance to serve peak demand. This
is a problem because it is expensive and because it poses risks to
availability if you underestimate the workload's peak capacity
needs.

In the cloud, you don't have to do this. Instead, you can provision
compute, database, and other resource capacity as needed to meet
current and forecasted demand. Automated solutions such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Application Auto Scaling can bring resources
online for you based on metrics you specify. This can make the
scaling process easier and predictable, and it can make your
workload significantly more reliable by ensuring you have enough
resources available at all times.

**Desired outcome**: You configure
automatic scaling of compute and other resources to meet demand. You
provide sufficient headroom in your scaling policies to allow bursts
of traffic to be served while additional resources are brought
online.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You provision a fixed number of scalable resources.
- You choose a scaling metric that does not correlate to actual
demand.
- You fail to provide enough headroom in your scaling plans to
accommodate demand bursts.
- Your scaling policies add capacity too late, which leads to
capacity exhaustion and degraded service while additional
resources are brought online.
- You fail to correctly configure minimum and maximum resource
counts, which leads to scaling failures.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Having enough resources to meet current demand
is critical to provide high availability of your workload and adhere
to your defined service-level objectives (SLOs). Automatic scaling
allows you to provide the right amount of compute, database, and
other resources your workload needs in order to serve current and
forecasted demand. You don't need to determine peak capacity needs
and statically allocate resources to serve it. Instead, as demand
grows, you can allocate more resources to accommodate it, and after
demand falls, you can deactivate resources to reduce cost.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

First, determine whether the workload component is suitable for
automatic scaling. These components are called
*horizontally scalable* because they provide
the same resources and behave identically. Examples of
horizontally-scalable components include EC2 instances that are
configured alike,
[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) tasks, and pods running on
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). These compute resources are
typically located behind a load balancer and are referred to as
*replicas*.

Other replicated resources may include database read replicas,
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables, and
[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) (Redis OSS) clusters. For a complete list of
supported resources, see
[AWS services that you can use with Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/integrated-services-list.html).

For container-based architectures, you may need to scale two
different ways. First, you may need to scale the containers that
provide horizontally-scalable services. Second, you may need to
scale the compute resources to make space for new containers.
Different automatic scaling mechanisms exist for each layer. To
scale ECS tasks, you can use
[Application
Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html). To scale Kubernetes pods, you can use
[Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) or
[Kubernetes Event-driven
Autoscaling (KEDA)](https://keda.sh/). To scale the compute resources, you can
use
[Capacity
Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/asg-capacity-providers.html) for ECS, or for Kubernetes, you can use
[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh) or
[Cluster
Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cluster-autoscaling/).

Next, select how you will perform automatic scaling. There are
three major options: metric-based scaling, scheduled scaling, and
predictive scaling.

**Metric-based scaling**

Metric-based scaling provisions resources based on the value of
one or more *scaling metrics*. A scaling metric
is one that corresponds to your workload's demand. A good way to
determine appropriate scaling metrics is to perform load testing
in a non-production environment. During your load tests, keep the
number of scalable resources fixed, and slowly increase demand
(for example, throughput, concurrency, or simulated users). Then
look for metrics that increase (or decrease) as demand grows, and
conversely decrease (or increase) as demand falls. Typical scaling
metrics include CPU utilization, work queue depth (such as an
[Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
queue), number of active users, and network throughput.

Note
AWS has observed that
with most applications, memory utilization increases as the
application warms up and then reaches a steady value. When demand
decreases, memory utilization typically remains elevated rather
than decreasing in parallel. Because memory utilization does not
correspond to demand in both directions–that is, growing and
falling with demand–consider carefully before you select this
metric for automatic scaling.

Metric-based scaling is a *latent operation*.
It can take several minutes for utilization metrics to propagate
to auto scaling mechanisms, and these mechanisms typically wait
for a clear signal of increased demand before reacting. Then, as
the auto scaler creates new resources, it can take additional time
for them to come to full service. Because of this, it is important
to not set your scaling metric targets too close to full
utilization (for example, 90% CPU utilization). Doing so risks
exhausting existing resource capacity before additional capacity
can come online. Typical resource utilization targets can range
between 50-70% for optimum availability, depending on demand
patterns and time required to provision additional resources.

**Scheduled scaling**

Scheduled scaling provisions or removes resources based on the
calendar or time of day. It is frequently used for workloads that
have predictable demand, such as peak utilization during weekday
business hours or sales events. Both
[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html) and
[Application
Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html) support scheduled scaling. KEDA's
[cron
scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/cron/) supports scheduled scaling of Kubernetes pods.

**Predictive scaling**

Predictive scaling uses machine learning to automatically scale
resources based on anticipated demand. Predictive scaling analyzes
the historical value of a utilization metric you provide and
continuously predicts its future value. The predicted value is
then used to scale the resource up or down.
[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html) can perform predictive scaling.

### Implementation steps

- Determine whether the workload component is suitable for
automatic scaling.
- Determine what kind of scaling mechanism is most appropriate
for the workload: metric-based scaling, scheduled scaling,
or predictive scaling.
- Select the appropriate automatic scaling mechanism for the
component. For Amazon EC2 instances, use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. For other AWS services, use Application Auto
Scaling. For Kubernetes pods (such as those running in an
Amazon EKS cluster), consider Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
(HPA) or Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA). For
Kubernetes or EKS nodes, consider Karpenter and Cluster Auto
Scaler (CAS).
- For metric or scheduled scaling, conduct load testing to
determine the appropriate scaling metrics and target values
for your workload. For scheduled scaling, determine the
number of resources needed at the dates and times you
select. Determine the maximum number of resources needed to
serve expected peak traffic.
- Configure the auto scaler based on the information collected
above. Consult the auto scaling service's documentation for
details. Verify that the maximum and minimum scaling limits
are configured correctly.
- Verify the scaling configuration is working as expected.
Perform load testing in a non-production environment and
observe how the system reacts, and adjust as needed. When
enabling auto scaling in production, configure appropriate
alarms to notify you of any unexpected behavior.

# REL07-BP04 Load test your workload

Adopt a load testing methodology to measure if scaling activity
meets workload requirements.

It’s important to perform sustained load testing. Load tests should
discover the breaking point and test the performance of your
workload. AWS makes it easy to set up temporary testing environments
that model the scale of your production workload. In the cloud, you
can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete
your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only
pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate
your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on
premises.

Load testing in production should also be considered as part of game
days where the production system is stressed, during hours of lower
customer usage, with all personnel on hand to interpret results and
address any problems that arise.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Performing load testing on deployments that are not the same
configuration as your production.
- Performing load testing only on individual pieces of your
workload, and not on the entire workload.
- Performing load testing with a subset of requests and not a
representative set of actual requests.
- Performing load testing to a small safety factor above expected
load.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** You know what components in your architecture
fail under load and be able to identify what metrics to watch to
indicate that you are approaching that load in time to address the
problem, preventing the impact of that failure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- Perform load testing to identify which aspect of your workload
indicates that you must add or remove capacity. Load testing
should have representative traffic similar to what you receive in
production. Increase the load while watching the metrics you have
instrumented to determine which metric indicates when you must add
or remove resources.

[Distributed
Load Testing on AWS: simulate thousands of connected users](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/)

Identify the mix of requests. You may have varied mixes of requests, so you
should look at various time frames when identifying the mix of traffic.
- Implement a load driver. You can use custom code, open source, or commercial
software to implement a load driver.
- Load test initially using small capacity. You see some immediate effects by
driving load onto a lesser capacity, possibly as small as one instance or
container.
- Load test against larger capacity. The effects will be different on a
distributed load, so you must test against as close to a product environment as
possible.

## Question REL08

# REL 8 — How do you implement change?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 5

---

# REL08-BP01 Use runbooks for standard activities such as deployment

Runbooks are the predefined procedures to achieve specific outcomes.
Use runbooks to perform standard activities, whether done manually
or automatically. Examples include deploying a workload, patching a
workload, or making DNS modifications.

For example, put processes in place
to [ensure
rollback safety during deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/ensuring-rollback-safety-during-deployments). Ensuring that you can
roll back a deployment without any disruption for your customers is
critical in making a service reliable.

For runbook procedures, start with a valid effective manual process,
implement it in code, and invoke it to automatically run where
appropriate.

Even for sophisticated workloads that are highly automated, runbooks
are still useful
for [running
game days](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/test-reliability.html#GameDays) or meeting rigorous reporting and auditing
requirements.

Note that playbooks are used in response to specific incidents, and
runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes. Often, runbooks are
for routine activities, while playbooks are used for responding to
non-routine events.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Performing unplanned changes to configuration in production.
- Skipping steps in your plan to deploy faster, resulting in a
failed deployment.
- Making changes without testing the reversal of the change.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Effective change planning increases your
ability to successfully run the change because you are aware of
all the systems impacted. Validating your change in test
environments increases your confidence.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- Provide consistent and prompt responses to well-understood events
by documenting procedures in runbooks.
- Use the principle of infrastructure as code to define your
infrastructure. By using AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third
party) to define your infrastructure, you can use version control
software to version and track changes.

Use AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third-party provider) to define your infrastructure.

[What is AWS CloudFormation?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)

- Create templates that are singular and decoupled, using good software design
principles.

Determine the permissions, templates, and responsible parties for
implementation.

[Controlling access with AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html)

- Use a hosted source code management system based on a popular technology such as Git to store your source code and infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration.

# REL08-BP02 Integrate functional testing as part of your deployment

Use techniques such as unit tests and integration tests that
validate required functionality.

Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional
unit of code to validate its behavior. Integration testing seeks to
validate that each application feature works according to the
software requirements. While unit tests focus on testing part of an
application in isolation, integration tests consider side effects
(for example, the effect of data being changed through a mutation
operation). In either case, tests should be integrated into a
deployment pipeline, and if success criteria are not met, the
pipeline is halted or rolled back. These tests are run in a
pre-production environment, which is staged prior to production in
the pipeline.

You achieve the best outcomes when these tests are run automatically
as part of build and deployment actions. For instance, with AWS CodePipeline, developers commit changes to a source repository where
CodePipeline automatically detects the changes. The application is
built, and unit tests are run. After the unit tests have passed, the
built code is deployed to staging servers for testing. From the
staging server, CodePipeline runs more tests, such as integration or
load tests. Upon the successful completion of those tests,
CodePipeline deploys the tested and approved code to production
instances.

**Desired outcome:** You use
automation to perform unit and integration tests to validate that
your code behaves as expected. These tests are integrated into the
deployment process, and a test failure aborts the deployment.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You ignore or bypass test failures and plans during the
deployment process in order to accelerate the deployment
timeline.
- You manually perform tests outside the deployment pipeline.
- You skip testing steps in the automation through manual
emergency workflows.
- You run automated tests in an environment that does not closely
resemble the production environment.
- You build a test suite that is insufficiently flexible and is
difficult to maintain, update, or scale as the application
evolves.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automated testing during the deployment process
catches issues early, which reduces the risk of a release to
production with bugs or unexpected behavior. Unit tests validate the
code behaves as desired and API contracts are honored. Integration
tests validate that the system operates according to specified
requirements. These types of tests verify the intended working order
of components such as user interfaces, APIs, databases, and source
code.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach to writing
software, where you develop test cases to specify and validate
your code. To start, create test cases for each function. If the
test fails, you write new code to pass the test. This approach
helps you validate the expected result of each function. Run unit
tests and validate that they pass before you commit code to a
source code repository.

Implement both unit and integration tests as part of the build,
test, and deployment stages of the CI/CD pipeline. Automate
testing, and automatically initiate tests whenever a new version
of the application is ready to be deployed. If success criteria
are not met, the pipeline is halted or rolled back.

If the application is a web or mobile app, perform automated
integration testing on multiple desktop browsers or real devices.
This approach is particularly useful to validate the compatibility
and functionality of mobile apps across a diverse range of
devices.

### Implementation steps

- Write unit tests before you write functional code
(*test-driven development*, or TDD).
Establish code guidelines so that writing and running unit
tests are a non-functional coding requirement.
- Create a suite of automated integration tests that cover the
identified testable functionalities. These tests should
simulate user interactions and validate the expected
outcomes.
- Create the necessary test environment to run the integration
tests. This may include staging or pre-production
environments that closely mimic the production environment.
- Set up your source, build, test, and deploy stages using the
AWS CodePipeline console or AWS Command Line Interface
(CLI).
- Deploy the application once the code has been built and
tested. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy it to your staging
(testing) and production environments. These environments
may include Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, or
on-premises servers. The same deployment mechanism should be
used to deploy the application to all environments.
- Monitor the progress of your pipeline and the status of each
stage. Use quality checks to block the pipeline based on the
status of your tests. You can also receive notifications for
any pipeline stage failure or pipeline completion.
- Continually monitor the results of the tests, and look for
patterns, regressions or areas that require more attention.
Use this information to improve the test suite, identify
areas of the application that need more robust testing, and
optimize the deployment process.

# REL08-BP03 Integrate resiliency testing as part of your deployment

Integrate resiliency testing by consciously introducing failures in
your system to measure its capability in case of disruptive
scenarios. Resilience tests are different from unit and function
tests that are usually integrated in deployment cycles, as they
focus on the identification of unanticipated failures in your
system. While it is safe to start with resiliency testing
integration in pre-production, set a goal to implement these tests
in production as a part of your
[game
days](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/test-reliability.html#GameDays).

**Desired outcome**: Resiliency
testing helps build confidence in the system's ability to withstand
degradation in production. Experiments identify weak points that
could lead to failure, which helps you improve your system to
automatically and efficiently mitigate failure and degradation.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Lack of observability and monitoring in deployment processes
- Reliance on humans to resolve system failures
- Poor quality analysis mechanisms
- Focus on known issues in a system and a lack of experimentation
to identify any unknowns
- Identification of failures, but no resolution
- No documentation of findings and runbooks

**Benefits of establishing best
practices:** Resilience testing integrated in your
deployments helps to identify unknown issues in the system that
otherwise go unnoticed, which can lead to downtime in production.
Identification of these unknowns in a system helps you document
findings, integrate testing into your CI/CD process, and build
runbooks, which simplify mitigation through efficient, repeatable
mechanisms.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

The most common resiliency testing forms that can be integrated in
your system's deployments are disaster recovery and chaos
engineering.

- Include updates to your disaster recovery plans and standard
operating procedures (SOPs) with any significant deployment.
- Integrate reliability testing into your automated deployment
pipelines. Services such
as[AWS Resilience Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/)can be
[integrated
into your CI/CD pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/continually-assessing-application-resilience-with-aws-resilience-hub-and-aws-codepipeline/) to establish continuous
resilience assessments that are automatically evaluated as
part of every deployment.
- Define your applications in AWS Resilience Hub. Resilience
assessments generate code snippets that help you create
recovery procedures as AWS Systems Manager documents for your
applications and provide a list of recommended Amazon CloudWatch monitors and alarms.
- Once your DR plans and SOPs are updated, complete disaster
recovery testing to verify that they are effective. Disaster
recovery testing helps you determine if you can restore your
system after an event and return to normal operations. You can
simulate various disaster recovery strategies and identify
whether your planning is sufficient to meet your uptime
requirements. Common disaster recovery strategies include
backup and restore, pilot light, cold standby, warm standby,
hot standby, and active-active, and they all differ in cost
and complexity. Before disaster recovery testing, we recommend
that you define your recovery time objective (RTO) and
recovery point objective (RPO) to simplify the choice of
strategy to simulate. AWS offers disaster recovery tools like
[AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/) to help you get started with
your planning and testing.
- Chaos engineering experiments introduce disruptions to the
system, such as network outages and service failures. By
simulating with controlled failures, you can discover your
system's vulnerabilities while containing the impacts of the
injected failures. Just like the other strategies, run
controlled failure simulations in non-production environments
using services like
[AWS Fault Injection Service](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) to gain confidence before deploying
in production.

# REL08-BP04 Deploy using immutable infrastructure

Immutable infrastructure is a model that mandates that no updates,
security patches, or configuration changes happen in-place on
production workloads. When a change is needed, the architecture is
built onto new infrastructure and deployed into production.

Follow an immutable infrastructure deployment strategy to increase the reliability, consistency, and reproducibility in your workload deployments.

**Desired outcome:** With immutable infrastructure, no [in-place modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/deployment-strategies.html#in-place-deployments) are allowed to run infrastructure resources within a workload. Instead, when a change is needed, a new set of updated infrastructure resources containing all the necessary changes are deployed in parallel to your existing resources. This deployment is validated automatically, and if successful, traffic is gradually shifted to the new set of resources.

This deployment strategy applies to software updates, security patches, infrastructure changes, configuration updates, and application updates, among others.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing in-place changes to running infrastructure resources.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- **Increased consistency across environments:** Since there are no differences in infrastructure resources across environments, consistency is increased and testing is simplified.
- **Reduction in configuration drifts:** By replacing infrastructure resources with a known and version-controlled configuration, the infrastructure is set to a known, tested, and trusted state, avoiding configuration drifts.
- **Reliable atomic deployments:** Deployments either complete successfully or nothing changes, increasing consistency and reliability in the deployment process.
- **Simplified deployments:** Deployments are simplified because they don't need to support upgrades. Upgrades are just new deployments.
- **Safer deployments with fast rollback and recovery processes:** Deployments are safer because the previous working version is not changed. You can roll back to it if errors are detected.
- **Enhanced security posture:** By not allowing changes to infrastructure, remote access mechanisms (such as SSH) can be disabled. This reduces the attack vector, improving your organization's security posture.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

**Automation**

When defining an immutable infrastructure deployment strategy, it is recommended to use [automation](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) as much as possible to increase reproducibility and minimize the potential of human error. For more detail, see [REL08-BP05 Deploy changes with automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_tracking_change_management_automated_changemgmt.html) and [Automating safe, hands-off deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/).

With [infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html), infrastructure provisioning, orchestration, and deployment steps are defined in a programmatic, descriptive, and declarative way and stored in a source control system. Leveraging infrastructure as code makes it simpler to automate infrastructure deployment and helps achieve infrastructure immutability.

**Deployment patterns**

When a change in the workload is required, the immutable infrastructure deployment strategy mandates that a new set of infrastructure resources is deployed, including all necessary changes. It is important for this new set of resources to follow a rollout pattern that minimizes user impact. There are two main strategies for this deployment:

[Canary
deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/canary-deployments.html): The practice of directing a small
number of your customers to the new version, usually running on a
single service instance (the canary). You then deeply scrutinize any
behavior changes or errors that are generated. You can remove
traffic from the canary if you encounter critical problems and send
the users back to the previous version. If the deployment is
successful, you can continue to deploy at your desired velocity,
while monitoring the changes for errors, until you are fully
deployed. AWS CodeDeploy can be configured with a [deployment
configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.html) that allows a canary deployment.

[Blue/green
deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html): Similar to the canary deployment,
except that a full fleet of the application is deployed in parallel.
You alternate your deployments across the two stacks (blue and
green). Once again, you can send traffic to the new version, and
fall back to the old version if you see problems with the
deployment. Commonly all traffic is switched at once, however you
can also use fractions of your traffic to each version to dial up
the adoption of the new version using the weighted DNS
routing capabilities of Amazon Route 53. AWS CodeDeploy and [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/relnotes/release-2020-05-18-ts-deploy.html) can be configured with a deployment configuration
that allows a blue/green deployment.

*Figure 8: Blue/green deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
and Amazon Route 53*

**Drift detection**

*Drift* is defined as any change that causes an infrastructure resource to have a different state or configuration to what is expected. Any type of unmanaged configuration change goes against the notion of immutable infrastructure, and should be detected and remediated in order to have a successful implementation of immutable infrastructure.

### Implementation steps

- Disallow the in-place modification of running infrastructure resources.

You can use [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) to specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.

- Automate the deployment of infrastructure resources to increase reproducibility and minimize the potential of human error.

As described in the [Introduction to DevOps on AWS whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/automation.html), automation is a cornerstone with AWS services and is internally supported in all services, features, and offerings.
- *[Prebaking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/prebaking-vs.-bootstrapping-amis.html)* your Amazon Machine Image (AMI) can speed up the time to launch them. [EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) is a fully managed AWS service that helps you automate the creation, maintenance, validation, sharing, and deployment of customized, secure, and up-to-date Linux or Windows custom AMI.
- Some of the services that support automation are:

[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) is a service to rapidly deploy and scale web applications developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, NGINX, Passenger, and IIS.
- [AWS Proton](https://aws.amazon.com/proton/) helps platform teams connect and coordinate all the different tools your development teams need for infrastructure provisioning, code deployments, monitoring, and updates. AWS Proton enables automated infrastructure as code provisioning and deployment of serverless and container-based applications.

- Leveraging infrastructure as code makes it easy to automate infrastructure deployment, and helps achieve infrastructure immutability. AWS provides services that enable the creation, deployment, and maintenance of infrastructure in a programmatic, descriptive, and declarative way.

[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) helps developers create AWS resources in an orderly and predictable fashion. Resources are written in text files using JSON or YAML format. The templates require a specific syntax and structure that depends on the types of resources being created and managed.

# REL08-BP05 Deploy changes with automation

Deployments and patching are automated to eliminate negative impact.

Making changes to production systems is one of the largest risk
areas for many organizations. We consider deployments a first-class
problem to be solved alongside the business problems that the
software addresses. Today, this means the use of automation wherever
practical in operations, including testing and deploying changes,
adding or removing capacity, and migrating data.

**Desired outcome:** You build
automated deployment safety into the release process with extensive
pre-production testing, automatic rollbacks, and staggered
production deployments. This automation minimizes the potential
impact on production caused by failed deployments, and developers no
longer need to actively watch deployments to production.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You perform manual changes.
- You skip steps in your automation through manual emergency
workflows.
- You don't follow your established plans and processes in favor
of accelerated timelines.
- You perform rapid follow-on deployments without allowing for
bake time.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When you use automation to deploy all changes,
you remove the potential for introduction of human error and provide
the ability to test before you change production. Performing this
process prior to production push verifies that your plans are
complete. Additionally, automatic rollback into your release process
can identify production issues and return your workload to its
previously-working operational state.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Automate your deployment pipeline. Deployment pipelines allow you
to invoke automated testing and detection of anomalies, and either
halt the pipeline at a certain step before production deployment,
or automatically roll back a change. An integral part of this is
the adoption of the culture
of [continuous
integration and continuous delivery/deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) (CI/CD),
where a commit or code change passes through various automated
stage gates from build and test stages to deployment on production
environments.

Although conventional wisdom suggests that you keep people in the
loop for the most difficult operational procedures, we suggest
that you automate the most difficult procedures for that very
reason.

### Implementation steps

You can automate deployments to remove manual operations by
following these steps:

- **Set up a code repository to store
your code securely:** Use a hosted source code management system based on a popular technology such as Git to store your source code and infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration.
- **Configure a continuous integration
service to compile your source code, run tests, and create
deployment artifacts:** To set up a build project
for this purpose, see
[Getting
started with AWS CodeBuild using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).
- **Set up a deployment service that
automates application deployments and handles the complexity
of application updates without reliance on error-prone
manual deployments:**
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) automates software deployments to a
variety of compute services, such as Amazon EC2,
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/),
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), and your on-premise servers. To configure
these steps, see
[Getting
started with CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/getting-started-codedeploy.html).
- **Set up a continuous delivery service
that automates your release pipelines for quicker and more
reliable application and infrastructure updates:**
Consider using
[AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/getting-started-codepipeline.html) to help you automate your release
pipelines. For more detail, see
[CodePipeline
tutorials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials.html).

## Question REL09

# REL 9 — How do you back up data?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# REL09-BP01 Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources

Understand and use the backup capabilities of the data services and resources used by the workload. Most services provide capabilities to back up workload data.

**Desired outcome:** Data sources have been identified and classified based on
criticality. Then, establish a strategy for data recovery based on
the RPO. This strategy involves either backing up these data
sources, or having the ability to reproduce data from other sources.
In the case of data loss, the strategy implemented allows recovery
or the reproduction of data within the defined RPO and RTO.

**Cloud maturity phase:**
Foundational

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not aware of all data sources for the workload and their
criticality.
- Not taking backups of critical data sources.
- Taking backups of only some data sources without using
criticality as a criterion.
- No defined RPO, or backup frequency cannot meet RPO.
- Not evaluating if a backup is necessary or if data can be
reproduced from other sources.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Identifying the places where backups are
necessary and implementing a mechanism to create backups, or being
able to reproduce the data from an external source improves the
ability to restore and recover data during an outage.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

All AWS data stores offer backup capabilities. Services such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB additionally support automated backup that allows point-in-time recovery (PITR), which allows you to restore a backup to any time up to five minutes or less before the current time. Many AWS services offer the ability to copy backups to another AWS Region. AWS Backup is a tool that gives you the ability to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services. [AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/) allows you to copy full server workloads and maintain continuous data protection from on-premise, cross-AZ or cross-Region, with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) measured in seconds.

Amazon S3 can be used as a backup destination for self-managed and AWS-managed data sources. AWS services such as Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB have built in capabilities to create backups. Third-party backup software can also be used.

On-premises data can be backed up to the AWS Cloud using [AWS Storage Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/vgw/WhatIsStorageGateway.html) or [AWS DataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/what-is-datasync.html). Amazon S3 buckets can be used to store this data on AWS. Amazon S3 offers multiple storage tiers such as [Amazon Glacier or Amazon Glacier Deep Archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/backup-recovery/amazon-s3-glacier.html) to reduce cost of data storage.

You might be able to meet data recovery needs by reproducing the data from other sources. For example, [Amazon ElastiCache replica nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Replication.Redis.Groups.html) or [Amazon RDS read replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) could be used to reproduce data if the primary is lost. In cases where sources like this can be used to meet your [Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html), you might not require a backup. Another example, if working with Amazon EMR, it might not be necessary to backup your HDFS data store, as long as you can [reproduce the data into Amazon EMR from Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/copy-s3-hdfs-emr/).

When selecting a backup strategy, consider the time it takes to recover data. The time needed to recover data depends on the type of backup (in the case of a backup strategy), or the complexity of the data reproduction mechanism. This time should fall within the RTO for the workload.

**Implementation steps**

- **Identify all data sources for the
workload**. Data can be stored on a number of
resources such as
[databases](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/),
[volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html),
[filesystems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html),
[logging
systems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html), and
[object
storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). Refer to the
**Resources** section to find
**Related documents** on
different AWS services where data is stored, and the backup
capability these services provide.
- **Classify data sources based on
criticality**. Different data sets will have
different levels of criticality for a workload, and therefore
different requirements for resiliency. For example, some data
might be critical and require a RPO near zero, while other
data might be less critical and can tolerate a higher RPO and
some data loss. Similarly, different data sets might have
different RTO requirements as well.
- **Use AWS or third-party services to
create backups of the data**.
[AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html) is a managed service that allows creating
backups of various data sources on AWS. [AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/) handles automated sub-second data
replication to an AWS Region. Most AWS services
also have native capabilities to create backups. The AWS Marketplace has many solutions that provide these capabilites
as well. Refer to the
**Resources** listed below for
information on how to create backups of data from various AWS
services.
- **For data that is not backed up,
establish a data reproduction mechanism**. You might
choose not to backup data that can be reproduced from other
sources for various reasons. There might be a situation where
it is cheaper to reproduce data from sources when needed
rather than creating a backup as there may be a cost
associated with storing backups. Another example is where
restoring from a backup takes longer than reproducing the data
from sources, resulting in a breach in RTO. In such
situations, consider tradeoffs and establish a well-defined
process for how data can be reproduced from these sources when
data recovery is necessary. For example, if you have loaded
data from Amazon S3 to a data warehouse (like Amazon Redshift), or MapReduce cluster (like Amazon EMR) to do
analysis on that data, this may be an example of data that can
be reproduced from other sources. As long as the results of
these analyses are either stored somewhere or reproducible,
you would not suffer a data loss from a failure in the data
warehouse or MapReduce cluster. Other examples that can be
reproduced from sources include caches (like Amazon ElastiCache) or RDS read replicas.
- **Establish a cadence for backing up
data**. Creating backups of data sources is a
periodic process and the frequency should depend on the RPO.

**Level of effort for the Implementation
Plan:** Moderate

# REL09-BP02 Secure and encrypt backups

Control and detect access to backups using authentication and authorization. Prevent and detect if data integrity of backups is compromised using encryption.

Implement security controls to prevent unauthorized access to backup data. Encrypt backups to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Having the same access to the backups and restoration automation
as you do to the data.
- Not encrypting your backups.
- Not implementing immutability for protection against deletion or tampering.
- Using the same security domain for production and backup systems.
- Not validating backup integrity through regular testing.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Securing your backups prevents tampering with
the data, and encryption of the data prevents access to that data if
it is accidentally exposed.
- Enhanced protection against ransomware and other cyber threats that target backup infrastructure.
- Reduced recovery time following a cyber incident through validated recovery processes.
- Improved business continuity capabilities during security incidents.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Control and detect access to backups using authentication and authorization, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Prevent and detect if data integrity of backups is compromised using encryption.

Amazon S3 supports several methods of encryption of your data at
rest. Using server-side encryption, Amazon S3 accepts your objects
as unencrypted data, and then encrypts them as they are stored.
Using client-side encryption, your workload application is
responsible for encrypting the data before it is sent to Amazon S3.
Both methods allow you to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
to create and store the data key, or you can provide your own key,
which you are then responsible for. Using AWS KMS, you can set
policies using IAM on who can and cannot access your data keys and
decrypted data.

For Amazon RDS, if you have chosen to encrypt your databases, then
your backups are encrypted also. DynamoDB backups are always
encrypted. When using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery, all data in transit and at rest is encrypted. With Elastic Disaster Recovery, data at rest can be encrypted using either the default Amazon EBS encryption Volume Encryption Key or a custom customer-managed key.

**Cyber resilience considerations**

To enhance backup security against cyber threats, consider implementing these additional controls besides encryption:

- Implement immutability using AWS Backup Vault Lock or Amazon S3 Object Lock to prevent backup data from being altered or deleted during its retention period, protecting against ransomware and malicious deletion.
- Establish logical isolation between production and backup environments with AWS Backup logically air-gapped vault for critical systems, creating separation that helps prevent compromise of both environments simultaneously.
- Validate backup integrity regularly using AWS Backup restore testing to verify that backups are not corrupted and can be successfully restored following a cyber incident.
- Implement multi-party approval for critical recovery operations using AWS Backup multi-party approval to prevent unauthorized or malicious recovery attempts by requiring authorization from multiple designated approvers.

### Implementation steps

- Use encryption on each of your data stores. If your source data is
encrypted, then the backup will also be encrypted.

[Use encryption in Amazon RDS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html). You can configure encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service
when you create an RDS instance.
- [Use encryption on Amazon EBS volumes.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html). You can configure default encryption or specify
a unique key upon volume creation.
- Use the required [Amazon DynamoDB encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/EncryptionAtRest.html). DynamoDB encrypts all data at rest. You can
either use an AWS owned AWS KMS key or an AWS managed KMS key, specifying a key that
is stored in your account.
- [Encrypt your data stored in Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption.html). Configure the encryption when you create your
file system.
- Configure the encryption in the source and destination Regions. You can configure
encryption at rest in Amazon S3 using keys stored in KMS, but the keys are Region-specific.
You can specify the destination keys when you configure the replication.
- Choose whether to use the default or custom [Amazon EBS encryption for Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/volumes-drs.html#ebs-encryption). This option will encrypt your replicated data at rest on the Staging Area Subnet disks and the replicated disks.

- Implement least privilege permissions to access your backups.
Follow best practices to limit the access to the backups,
snapshots, and replicas in accordance with [security best
practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html).
- Configure immutability for critical backups. For critical data, implement AWS Backup Vault Lock or S3 Object Lock to prevent deletion or alteration during the specified retention period. For implementation details, see [AWS Backup Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html).
- Create logical separation for backup environments. Implement AWS Backup logically air-gapped vault for critical systems requiring enhanced protection from cyber threats. For implementation guidance, see [Building cyber resiliency with AWS Backup logically air-gapped vault](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/building-cyber-resiliency-with-aws-backup-logically-air-gapped-vault/).
- Implement backup validation processes. Configure AWS Backup restore testing to regularly verify that backups are not corrupted and can be successfully restored following a cyber incident. For more information, see [Validate recovery readiness with AWS Backup restore testing](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/validate-recovery-readiness-with-aws-backup-restore-testing/).
- Configure multi-party approval for sensitive recovery operations. For critical systems, implement AWS Backup multi-party approval to require authorization from multiple designated approvers before recovery can proceed. For implementation details, see [Improve recovery resilience with AWS Backup support for Multi-party approval](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/improve-recovery-resilience-with-aws-backup-support-for-multi-party-approval/).

# REL09-BP03 Perform data backup automatically

Configure backups to be taken automatically based on a periodic schedule informed by the
Recovery Point Objective (RPO), or by changes in the dataset. Critical datasets with low data
loss requirements need to be backed up automatically on a frequent basis, whereas less
critical data where some loss is acceptable can be backed up less frequently.

**Desired outcome:** An automated process that creates backups of data sources at an
established cadence.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Performing backups manually.
- Using resources that have backup capability, but not including
the backup in your automation.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automating backups verifies that they are taken
regularly based on your RPO, and alerts you if they are not taken.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

AWS Backup can be used to create automated data backups of various
AWS data sources. Amazon RDS instances can be backed up almost
continuously every five minutes and Amazon S3 objects can be backed
up almost continuously every fifteen minutes, providing for
point-in-time recovery (PITR) to a specific point in time within the
backup history. For other AWS data sources, such as Amazon EBS
volumes, Amazon DynamoDB tables, or Amazon FSx file systems, AWS Backup can run automated backup as frequently as every hour. These
services also offer native backup capabilities. AWS services that
offer automated backup with point-in-time recovery
include [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery_Howitworks.html), [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html),
and [Amazon
Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery.html) – these can be restored to a
specific point in time within the backup history. Most other AWS
data storage services offer the ability to schedule periodic
backups, as frequently as every hour.

Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB offer continuous backup with point-in-time recovery. Amazon S3 versioning,
once turned on, is automatic. [Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-lifecycle.html) can be used to automate the creation, copy and deletion of Amazon EBS snapshots.
It can also automate the creation, copy, deprecation and deregistration of Amazon EBS-backed Amazon
Machine Images (AMIs) and their underlying Amazon EBS snapshots.

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery provides continuous block-level replication from the source
environment (on-premises or AWS) to the target recovery region. Point-in-time Amazon EBS snapshots are
automatically created and managed by the service.

For a centralized view of your backup automation and history, AWS Backup provides a fully managed, policy-based backup solution. It
centralizes and automates the back up of data across multiple AWS
services in the cloud as well as on premises using the AWS Storage Gateway.

In additional to versioning, Amazon S3 features replication. The
entire S3 bucket can be automatically replicated to another bucket
in the same, or a different AWS Region.

**Implementation steps**

- **Identify data sources** that
are currently being backed up manually. For more detail, see [REL09-BP01 Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources](./rel_backing_up_data_identified_backups_data.html).
- **Determine the RPO** for the
workload. For more detail, see [REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss](./rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html).
- **Use an automated backup solution or
managed service**. AWS Backup is a fully-managed
service that makes it easy to
[centralize
and automate data protection across AWS services, in the
cloud, and on-premises](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/creating-a-backup.html#creating-automatic-backups). Using backup plans in
AWS Backup, create rules which define the
resources to backup, and the frequency at which these backups
should be created. This frequency should be informed by the
RPO established in Step 2. For hands-on guidance on how to create
automated backups using AWS Backup, see
[Testing Backup and Restore of Data](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/).
Native backup capabilities
are offered by most AWS services that store data. For example,
RDS can be leveraged for automated backups with point-in-time
recovery (PITR).
- **For data sources not
supported** by an automated backup solution or
managed service such as on-premises data sources or message
queues, consider using a trusted third-party solution to
create automated backups. Alternatively, you can create
automation to do this using the AWS CLI or SDKs. You can use
AWS Lambda Functions or AWS Step Functions to define the logic
involved in creating a data backup, and use Amazon EventBridge
to invoke it at a frequency based on your RPO.

**Level of effort for the Implementation
Plan:** Low

# REL09-BP04 Perform periodic recovery of the data to verify backup integrity and processes

Validate that your backup process implementation meets your Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) by performing a recovery test.

**Desired outcome:** Data from
backups is periodically recovered using well-defined mechanisms to
verify that recovery is possible within the established recovery
time objective (RTO) for the workload. Verify that restoration from
a backup results in a resource that contains the original data
without any of it being corrupted or inaccessible, and with data
loss within the recovery point objective (RPO).

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Restoring a backup, but not querying or retrieving any data to
check that the restoration is usable.
- Assuming that a backup exists.
- Assuming that the backup of a system is fully operational and
that data can be recovered from it.
- Assuming that the time to restore or recover data from a backup
falls within the RTO for the workload.
- Assuming that the data contained on the backup falls within the
RPO for the workload
- Restoring when necessary, without using a runbook or outside of an
established automated procedure.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Testing the recovery of the backups verifies that
data can be restored when needed without having any worry that data
might be missing or corrupted, that the restoration and recovery is
possible within the RTO for the workload, and any data loss falls
within the RPO for the workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Testing backup and restore capability increases confidence in the
ability to perform these actions during an outage. Periodically
restore backups to a new location and run tests to verify the
integrity of the data. Some common tests that should be performed
are checking if all data is available, is not corrupted, is accessible, and that any data loss falls within the RPO for the workload. Such tests can also help ascertain if recovery mechanisms are fast enough to accommodate the workload's RTO.

Using AWS, you can stand up a testing environment and restore your
backups to assess RTO and RPO capabilities, and run tests on data
content and integrity.

Additionally, Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB allow point-in-time
recovery (PITR). Using continuous backup, you can restore your
dataset to the state it was in at a specified date and time.

If all the data is available, is not corrupted, is accessible, and
any data loss falls within the RPO for the workload. Such tests
can also help ascertain if recovery mechanisms are fast enough to
accommodate the workload's RTO.

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery offers continual point-in-time recovery snapshots of Amazon EBS volumes. As source servers are replicated, point-in-time states are chronicled over time based on the configured policy. Elastic Disaster Recovery helps you verify the integrity of these snapshots by launching instances for test and drill purposes without redirecting the traffic.

**Implementation steps**

- **Identify data sources** that
are currently being backed up and where these backups are
being stored. For implementation guidance, see [REL09-BP01 Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources](./rel_backing_up_data_identified_backups_data.html).
- **Establish criteria for data
validation** for each data source. Different types of
data will have different properties which might require
different validation mechanisms. Consider how this data might
be validated before you are confident to use it in production.
Some common ways to validate data are using data and backup
properties such as data type, format, checksum, size, or a
combination of these with custom validation logic. For
example, this might be a comparison of the checksum values
between the restored resource and the data source at the time
the backup was created.
- **Establish RTO and RPO** for
restoring the data based on data criticality. For implementation guidance, see
[REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss](./rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html).
- **Assess your recovery
capability**. Review your backup and restore strategy
to understand if it can meet your RTO and RPO, and adjust the
strategy as necessary. Using
[AWS Resilience Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/create-policy.html), you can run an assessment of your
workload. The assessment evaluates your application
configuration against the resiliency policy and reports if
your RTO and RPO targets can be met.
- **Do a test restore** using
currently established processes used in production for data
restoration. These processes depend on how the original data
source was backed up, the format and storage location of the
backup itself, or if the data is reproduced from other
sources. For example, if you are using a managed service such
as
[AWS Backup, this might be as simple as restoring the backup into a
new resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-a-backup.html). If you used AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery
you can
[launch
a recovery drill](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/failback-preparing.html).
- **Validate data recovery** from
the restored resource based on
criteria you previously established for data validation. Does the restored and recovered data contain the most
recent record or item at the time of backup? Does this data fall
within the RPO for the workload?
- **Measure time required** for
restore and recovery and compare it to your established RTO. Does this process fall within the RTO for the
workload? For example, compare the timestamps from when the
restoration process started and when the recovery validation
completed to calculate how long this process takes. All AWS
API calls are timestamped and this information is available in
[AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html). While this information can provide details
on when the restore process started, the end timestamp for
when the validation was completed should be recorded by your
validation logic. If using an automated process, then services
like
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) can be used to store this information.
Additionally, many AWS services provide an event history which
provides timestamped information when certain actions
occurred. Within AWS Backup, backup and restore actions are
referred to as *jobs*, and these jobs
contain timestamp information as part of its metadata which
can be used to measure time required for restoration and
recovery.
- **Notify stakeholders** if data
validation fails, or if the time required for restoration and
recovery exceeds the established RTO for the workload. When
implementing automation to do this,
[such
as in this lab](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/), services like Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) can be used to send push
notifications such as email or SMS to stakeholders.
[These
messages can also be published to messaging applications such
as Amazon Chime, Slack, or Microsoft Teams](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/sns-lambda-webhooks-chime-slack-teams/) or used to
[create
tasks as OpsItems using AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html).
- **Automate this process to run
periodically**. For example, services like AWS Lambda
or a State Machine in AWS Step Functions can be used to
automate the restore and recovery processes, and Amazon EventBridge can be used to invoke this automation workflow
periodically as shown in the architecture diagram below. Learn
how to
[Automate
data recovery validation with AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/automate-data-recovery-validation-with-aws-backup/). Additionally,
[this
Well-Architected lab](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/) provides a hands-on experience on
one way to do automation for several of the steps here.

*Figure 9. An automated backup and restore process*

**Level of effort for the Implementation
Plan:** Moderate to high depending on the complexity of
the validation criteria.

## Question REL10

# REL 10 — How do you use fault isolation to protect your workload?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 3

---

# REL10-BP01 Deploy the workload to multiple locations

Distribute workload data and resources across multiple Availability
Zones or, where necessary, across AWS Regions.

A fundamental principle for service design in AWS is to avoid single
points of failure, including the underlying physical infrastructure.
AWS provides cloud computing resources and services globally across
multiple geographic locations called
[Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/regions.html).
Each Region is physically and logically independent and consists of
three or more
[Availability
Zones (AZs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/availability-zones.html). Availability Zones are geographically close to
each other but are physically separated and isolated. When you
distribute your workloads among Availability Zones and Regions, you
mitigate the risk of threats such as fires, floods, weather-related
disasters, earthquakes, and human error.

Create a location strategy to provide high availability that is
appropriate for your workloads.

**Desired outcome:** Production
workloads are distributed among multiple Availability Zones (AZs) or
Regions to achieve fault tolerance and high availability.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your production workload exists only in a single Availability
Zone.
- You implement a multi-Region architecture when a multi-AZ
architecture would satisfy business requirements.
- Your deployments or data become desynchronized, which results in
configuration drift or under-replicated data.
- You don't account for dependencies between application
components if resilience and multi-location requirements differ
between those components.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Your workload is more resilient to incidents, such as power or
environmental control failures, natural disasters, upstream
service failures, or network issues that impact an AZ or an
entire Region.
- You can access a wider inventory of Amazon EC2 instances and
reduce the likelihood of
InsufficientCapacityExceptions (ICE) when
launching specific EC2 instance types.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Deploy and operate all production workloads in at least two
Availability Zones (AZs) in a Region.

**Using multiple Availability
Zones**

Availability Zones are resource hosting locations that are
physically separated from each other to avoid correlated failures
due to risks such as fires, floods, and tornadoes. Each
Availability Zone has independent physical infrastructure,
including utility power connections, backup power sources,
mechanical services, and network connectivity. This arrangement
limits faults in any of these components to just the impacted
Availability Zone. For example, if an AZ-wide incident makes EC2
instances unavailable in the affected Availability Zone, your
instances in other Availability Zone remains available.

Despite being physically separated, Availability Zones in the same
AWS Region are close enough to provide high-throughput,
low-latency (single-digit millisecond) networking. You can
replicate data synchronously between Availability Zones for most
workloads without significantly impacting user experience. This
means you can use Availability Zones in a Region in an
active/active or active/standby configuration.

All compute associated with your workload should be distributed
among multiple Availability Zones. This includes
[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
instances, [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) tasks, and VPC-attached
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. AWS compute services, including
[EC2
Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/),
[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), and
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), provide ways for you to launch
and manage compute across Availability Zones. Configure them to
automatically replace compute as needed in a different
Availability Zone to maintain availability. To direct traffic to
available Availability Zones, place a load balancer in front of
your compute, such as an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
Balancer. AWS load balancers can reroute traffic to available
instances in the event of an Availability Zone impairment.

You should also replicate data for your workload and make it
available in multiple Availability Zones. Some AWS managed data
services, such as
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Amazon Elastic File
Service (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/),
[Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/aurora/),
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/),
[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), and
[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/) replicate data in multiple
Availability Zones by default and are robust against Availability
Zone impairment. With other AWS managed data services, such as
[Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/),
[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), and
[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), you must enable multi-AZ replication. Once
enabled, these services automatically detect an Availability Zone
impairment, redirect requests to an available Availability Zone,
and re-replicate data as needed after recovery without customer
intervention. Familiarize yourself with the user guide for each
AWS managed data service you use to understand its multi-AZ
capabilities, behaviors, and operations.

If you are using self-managed storage, such as
[Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) volumes or Amazon EC2 instance storage,
you must manage multi-AZ replication yourself.

*Figure 9: Multi-tier architecture deployed across three
Availability Zones. Note that Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB are
always Multi-AZ automatically. The ELB also is deployed to all three
zones.*

**Using multiple AWS Regions**

If you have workloads that require extreme resilience (such as
critical infrastructure, health-related applications, or services
with stringent customer or mandated availability requirements),
you may require additional availability beyond what a single AWS Region can provide. In this case, you should deploy and operate
your workload across at least two AWS Regions (assuming that your
data residency requirements allow it).

AWS Regions are located in different geographical regions around
the world and in multiple continents. AWS Regions have even
greater physical separation and isolation than Availability
Zones alone. AWS services, with few exceptions, take advantage of
this design to operate fully independently between different
Regions (also known as *Regional services*). A
failure of an AWS Regional service is designed not to impact the
service in a different Region.

When you operate your workload in multiple Regions, you should
consider additional requirements. Because resources in different
Regions are separate from and independent of one another, you must
duplicate your workload's components in each Region. This includes
foundational infrastructure, such as VPCs, in addition to compute
and data services.

**NOTE:** When you consider a
multi-Regional design, verify that your workload is capable of
running in a single Region. If you create dependencies between
Regions where a component in one Region relies on services or
components in a different Region, you can increase the risk of
failure and significantly weaken your reliability posture.

To ease multi-Regional deployments and maintain consistency,
[AWS CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) can replicate your entire AWS
infrastructure across multiple Regions.
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) can also detect configuration drift and
inform you when your AWS resources in a Region are out of sync.
Many AWS services offer multi-region replication for important
workload assets. For example,
[EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) can publish your EC2 machine images (AMIs) after
every build to each Region you use.
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) can replicate your container
images to your selected Regions.

You must also replicate your data across each of your chosen
Regions. Many AWS managed data services provide cross-Regional
replication capability, including Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB,
Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticache,
and Amazon EFS.
[Amazon DynamoDB global tables](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/) accept writes in any supported
Region and will replicate data among all your other configured
Regions. With other services, you must designate a primary Region
for writes, as other Regions contain read-only replicas. For each
AWS-managed data service your workload uses, refer to its user
guide and developer guide to understand its multi-Region
capabilities and limitations. Pay special attention to where
writes must be directed, transactional capabilities and
limitations, how replication is performed, and how to monitor
synchronization between Regions.

AWS also provides the ability to route request traffic to your
Regional deployments with great flexibility. For example, you can
configure your DNS records using
[Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to direct traffic to the closest available Region to the
user. Alternatively, you can configure your DNS records in an
active/standby configuration, where you designate one Region as
primary and fall back to a Regional replica only if the primary
Region becomes unhealthy. You can configure
[Route 53 health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route%C2%A053/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html) to detect unhealthy endpoints and perform
automatic failover and additionally use
[Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/) to provide a
highly-available routing control for manually re-routing traffic
as needed.

Even if you choose not to operate in multiple Regions for high
availability, consider multiple Regions as part of your disaster
recovery (DR) strategy. If possible, replicate your workload's
infrastructure components and data in a *warm
standby* or *pilot light*
configuration in a secondary Region. In this design, you replicate
baseline infrastructure from the primary Region such as VPCs, Auto
Scaling groups, container orchestrators, and other components, but
you configure the variable-sized components in the standby Region
(such as the number of EC2 instances and database replicas) to be
a minimally-operable size. You also arrange for continuous data
replication from the primary Region to the standby Region. If an
incident occurs, you can then scale out, or grow, the resources in
the standby Region, and then promote it to become the primary
Region.

### Implementation steps

- Work with business stakeholders and data residency experts
to determine which AWS Regions can be used to host your
resources and data.
- Work with business and technical stakeholders to evaluate
your workload, and determine whether its resilience needs
can be met by a multi-AZ approach (single AWS Region) or if
they require a multi-Region approach (if multiple Regions
are permitted). The use of multiple Regions can achieve
greater availability but can involve additional complexity
and cost. Consider the following factors in your evaluation:

**Business objectives and customer
requirements**: How much downtime is permitted
should a workload-impacting incident occur in an
Availability Zone or a Region? Evaluate your recovery
point objectives as discussed in
[REL13-BP01
Define recovery objectives for downtime and data
loss](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html).
- **Disaster recovery (DR)
requirements**: What kind of potential disaster
do you want to insure yourself against? Consider the
possibility of data loss or long-term unavailability at
different scopes of impact from a single Availability
Zone to an entire Region. If you replicate data and
resources across Availability Zones, and a single
Availability Zone experiences a sustained failure, you
can recover service in another Availability Zone. If you
replicate data and resources across Regions, you can
recover service in another Region.

- Deploy your compute resources into multiple Availability
Zones.

In your VPC, create multiple subnets in different
Availability Zones. Configure each to be large enough to
accommodate the resources needed to serve the workload,
even during an incident. For more detail, see
[REL02-BP03
Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and
availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_network_topology_ip_subnet_allocation.html).
- If you are using Amazon EC2 instances, use
[EC2
Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) to manage your instances. Specify
the subnets you chose in the previous step when you
create your Auto Scaling groups.
- If you are using AWS Fargate compute for
[Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) or
[Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html), select the subnets you chose in the first
step when you create an ECS Service, launch an ECS task,
or create a
[Fargate
profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) for EKS.
- If you are using AWS Lambda functions that need to run
in your VPC, select the subnets you chose in the first
step when you create the Lambda function. For any
functions that do not have a VPC configuration, AWS Lambda manages availability for you automatically.
- Place traffic directors such as load balancers in front
of your compute resources. If cross-zone load balancing
is enabled,
[AWS Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) and
[Network
Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) detect when targets such as EC2
instances and containers are unreachable due to
Availability Zone impairment and reroute traffic towards
targets in healthy Availability Zones. If you disable
cross-zone load balancing, use Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) to provide zonal
shift capability. If you are using a third-party load
balancer or have implemented your own load balancers,
configure them with multiple front ends across different
Availability Zones.

- Replicate your workload's data across multiple Availability
Zones.

If you use an AWS-managed data service such as Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, or Amazon FSx, study its user
guide to understand its data replication and resilience
capabilities. Enable cross-AZ replication and failover
if necessary.
- If you use AWS-managed storage services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx, avoid using single-AZ or
One Zone configurations for data that requires high
durability. Use a multi-AZ configuration for these
services. Check the respective service's user guide to
determine whether multi-AZ replication is enabled by
default or whether you must enable it.
- If you run a self-managed database, queue, or other
storage service, arrange for multi-AZ replication
according to the application's instructions or best
practices. Familiarize yourself with the failover
procedures for your application.

- Configure your DNS service to detect AZ impairment and
reroute traffic to a healthy Availability Zone. Amazon Route 53, when used in combination with Elastic Load Balancers,
can do this automatically. Route 53 can also be configured
with failover records that use health checks to respond to
queries with only healthy IP addresses. For any DNS records
used for failover, specify a short time to live (TTL) value
(for example, 60 seconds or less) to help prevent record
caching from impeding recovery (Route 53 alias records
supply appropriate TTLs for you).

**Additional steps when using multiple AWS Regions**

- Replicate all operating system (OS) and application code
used by your workload across your selected Regions.
Replicate Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used by your EC2
instances if necessary using solutions such as Amazon EC2
Image Builder. Replicate container images stored in
registries using solutions such as Amazon ECR cross-Region
replication. Enable Regional replication for any Amazon S3
buckets used for storing application resources.
- Deploy your compute resources and configuration metadata
(such as parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter
Store) into multiple Regions. Use the same procedures
described in previous steps, but replicate the configuration
for each Region you are using for your workload. Use
infrastructure as code solutions such as AWS CloudFormation
to uniformly reproduce the configurations among Regions. If
you are using a secondary Region in a pilot light
configuration for disaster recovery, you may reduce the
number of your compute resources to a minimum value to save
cost, with a corresponding increase in time to recovery.
- Replicate your data from your primary Region into your
secondary Regions.

Amazon DynamoDB global tables provide global replicas of
your data that can be written to from any supported
Region. With other AWS-managed data services, such as
Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, and Amazon Elasticache, you
designate a primary (read/write) Region and replica
(read-only) Regions. Consult the respective services'
user and developer guides for details on Regional
replication.
- If you are running a self-managed database, arrange for
multi-Region replication according to the application's
instructions or best practices. Familiarize yourself
with the failover procedures for your application.
- If your workload uses AWS EventBridge, you may need to
forward selected events from your primary Region to your
secondary Regions. To do so, specify event buses in your
secondary Regions as targets for matched events in your
primary Region.

- Consider whether and to what extent you want to use
identical encryption keys across Regions. A typical approach
that balances security and ease of use is to use
Region-scoped keys for Region-local data and authentication,
and use globally-scoped keys for encryption of data that is
replicated among different Regions.
[AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) supports
[multi-region
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) to securely distribute and protect keys shared
across Regions.
- Consider AWS Global Accelerator to improve the availability
of your application by directing traffic to Regions that
contain healthy endpoints.

# REL10-BP02 Automate recovery for components constrained to a single location

If components of the workload can only run in a single Availability Zone or in an on-premises data center, implement the capability to do a complete rebuild of the workload within your defined recovery objectives.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

If the best practice to deploy the workload to multiple locations is
not possible due to technological constraints, you must implement an
alternate path to resiliency. You must automate the ability to
recreate necessary infrastructure, redeploy applications, and
recreate necessary data for these cases.

For example, Amazon EMR launches all nodes for a given cluster in
the same Availability Zone because running a cluster in the same
zone improves performance of the jobs flows as it provides a higher
data access rate. If this component is required for workload
resilience, then you must have a way to redeploy the cluster and its
data. Also for Amazon EMR, you should provision redundancy in ways
other than using Multi-AZ. You can
provision [multiple
nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-ha-launch.html).
Using [EMR
File System (EMRFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html), data in EMR can be stored in Amazon S3,
which in turn can be replicated across multiple Availability Zones
or AWS Regions.

Similarly, for Amazon Redshift, by default it provisions your
cluster in a randomly selected Availability Zone within the AWS Region that you select. All the cluster nodes are provisioned in the
same zone.

For stateful server-based workloads deployed to an on-premise data center, you can use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery to protect your workloads in AWS. If you are already hosted in AWS, you can use Elastic Disaster Recovery to protect your workload to an alternative Availability Zone or Region. Elastic Disaster Recovery uses continual block-level replication to a lightweight staging area to provide fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications.

**Implementation steps**

- Implement self-healing. Deploy your instances or containers using
automatic scaling when possible. If you cannot use automatic
scaling, use automatic recovery for EC2 instances or implement
self-healing automation based on Amazon EC2 or ECS container
lifecycle events.

Use [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) for instances and container workloads that have no
requirements for a single instance IP address, private IP address, Elastic IP address,
and instance metadata.

The launch template user data can be used to implement automation that can self-heal most workloads.

- Use automatic [recovery of Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html) for workloads that require a single
instance ID address, private IP address, elastic IP address, and instance metadata.

Automatic Recovery will send recovery status alerts to a SNS topic as the
instance failure is detected.

- Use [Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) or [Amazon ECS events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_cwe_events.html) to automate self-healing where
automatic scaling or EC2 recovery cannot be used.

Use the events to invoke automation that will heal your component
according to the process logic you require.

- Protect stateful workloads that are limited to a single location using [AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/what-is-drs.html).

# REL10-BP03 Use bulkhead architectures to limit scope of impact

Implement bulkhead architectures (also known as cell-based architectures) to restrict the effect of failure within a workload to a limited number of components.

**Desired outcome:** A cell-based architecture uses multiple isolated instances of a workload, where each instance is known as a cell. Each cell is independent, does not share state with other cells, and handles a subset of the overall workload requests. This reduces the potential impact of a failure, such as a bad software update, to an individual cell and the requests it is processing. If a workload uses 10 cells to service 100 requests, when a failure occurs, 90% of the overall requests would be unaffected by the failure.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Allowing cells to grow without bounds.
- Applying code updates or deployments to all cells at the same time.
- Sharing state or components between cells (with the exception of the router layer).
- Adding complex business or routing logic to the router layer.
- Not minimizing cross-cell interactions.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** With cell-based architectures, many common types of failure are contained within the cell itself, providing additional fault isolation. These fault boundaries can provide resilience against failure types that otherwise are hard to contain, such as unsuccessful code deployments or requests that are corrupted or invoke a specific failure mode (also known as *poison pill requests*).

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

On a ship, bulkheads ensure that a hull breach is contained within one section of the hull. In complex systems, this pattern is often replicated to allow fault isolation. Fault isolated boundaries restrict the effect of a failure within a workload to a limited number of components. Components outside of the boundary are unaffected by the failure. Using multiple fault isolated boundaries, you can limit the impact on your workload. On AWS, customers can use multiple Availability Zones and Regions to provide fault isolation, but the concept of fault isolation can be extended to your workload’s architecture as well.

The overall workload is partitioned cells by a partition key. This key needs to align with the *grain* of the service, or the natural way that a service's workload can be subdivided with minimal cross-cell interactions. Examples of partition keys are customer ID, resource ID, or any other parameter easily accessible in most API calls. A cell routing layer distributes requests to individual cells based on the partition key and presents a single endpoint to clients.

*Figure 11: Cell-based architecture*

**Implementation steps**

When designing a cell-based architecture, there are several design considerations to consider:

- **Partition key**: Special consideration should be taken
while choosing the partition key.

It should align with the grain of the service, or the natural way that a service's workload can be subdivided with minimal cross-cell interactions. Examples are `customer ID` or `resource ID`.
- The partition key must be available in all requests, either directly or in a way that could be easily inferred deterministically by other parameters.

- **Persistent cell mapping**: Upstream services should only
interact with a single cell for the lifecycle of their resources.

Depending on the workload, a cell migration strategy may be needed to migrate data from one cell to another. A possible scenario when a cell migration may be needed is if a particular user or resource in your workload becomes too big and requires it to have a dedicated cell.
- Cells should not share state or components between cells.
- Consequently, cross-cell interactions should be avoided or kept to a minimum, as those interactions create dependencies between cells and therefore diminish the fault isolation improvements.

- **Router layer**: The router layer is a shared component
between cells, and therefore cannot follow the same compartmentalization strategy as with
cells.

It is recommended for the router layer to distribute requests to individual cells using a partition mapping algorithm in a computationally efficient manner, such as combining cryptographic hash functions and modular arithmetic to map partition keys to cells.
- To avoid multi-cell impacts, the routing layer must remain as simple and horizontally scalable as possible, which necessitates avoiding complex business logic within this layer. This has the added benefit of making it easy to understand its expected behavior at all times, allowing for thorough testability. As explained by Colm MacCárthaigh in [Reliability, constant work, and a good cup of coffee](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/reliability-and-constant-work/), simple designs and constant work patterns produce reliable systems and reduce anti-fragility.

- **Cell size**: Cells should have a maximum size and should
not be allowed to grow beyond it.

The maximum size should be identified by performing thorough testing, until breaking points are reached and safe operating margins are established. For more detail on how to implement testing practices, see [REL07-BP04 Load test your workload](./rel_adapt_to_changes_load_tested_adapt.html)
- The overall workload should grow by adding additional cells, allowing the workload to scale with increases in demand.

- **Multi-AZ or Multi-Region strategies**: Multiple layers of
resilience should be leveraged to protect against different failure domains.

For resilience, you should use an approach that builds layers of defense. One layer protects against smaller, more common disruptions by building a highly available architecture using multiple AZs. Another layer of defense is meant to protect against rare events like widespread natural disasters and Region-level disruptions. This second layer involves architecting your application to span multiple AWS Regions. Implementing a multi-Region strategy for your workload helps protect it against widespread natural disasters that affect a large geographic region of a country, or technical failures of Region-wide scope. Be aware that implementing a multi-Region architecture can be significantly complex, and is usually not required for most workloads. For more detail, see [REL10-BP01 Deploy the workload to multiple locations](./rel_fault_isolation_multiaz_region_system.html).

- **Code deployment**: A staggered code deployment strategy
should be preferred over deploying code changes to all cells at the same time.

This helps minimize potential failure to multiple cells due to a bad deployment or human error. For more detail, see [Automating safe, hands-off deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/).

## Question REL11

# REL 11 — How do you design your workload to withstand component failures?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 7

---

# REL11-BP01 Monitor all components of the workload to detect failures

Continually monitor the health of your workload so that you and your
automated systems are aware of failures or degradations as soon as
they occur. Monitor for key performance indicators (KPIs) based on
business value.

All recovery and healing mechanisms must start with the ability to
detect problems quickly. Technical failures should be detected first
so that they can be resolved. However, availability is based on the
ability of your workload to deliver business value, so key
performance indicators (KPIs) that measure this need to be a part of
your detection and remediation strategy.

**Desired outcome:** Essential components of a workload are monitored independently to
detect and alert on failures when and where they happen.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- No alarms have been configured, so outages occur without
notification.
- Alarms exist, but at thresholds that don't provide adequate time
to react.
- Metrics are not collected often enough to meet the recovery time
objective (RTO).
- Only the customer facing interfaces of the workload are actively
monitored.
- Only collecting technical metrics, no business function metrics.
- No metrics measuring the user experience of the workload.
- Too many monitors are created.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Having appropriate monitoring at all layers allows you to reduce
recovery time by reducing time to detection.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Identify all workloads that will be reviewed for monitoring. Once
you have identified all components of the workload that will need
to monitored, you will now need to determine the monitoring
interval. The monitoring interval will have a direct impact on how
fast recovery can be initiated based on the time it takes to
detect a failure. The mean time to detection (MTTD) is the amount
of time between a failure occurring and when repair operations
begin. The list of services should be extensive and complete.

Monitoring must cover all layers of the application stack
including application, platform, infrastructure, and network.

Your monitoring strategy should consider the impact of
*gray failures*. For more detail on gray
failures, see
[Gray failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/advanced-multi-az-resilience-patterns/gray-failures.html) in the Advanced Multi-AZ Resilience Patterns whitepaper.

### Implementation steps

- Your monitoring interval is dependent on how quickly you
must recover. Your recovery time is driven by the time it
takes to recover, so you must determine the frequency of
collection by accounting for this time and your recovery
time objective (RTO).
- Configure detailed monitoring for components and managed
services.

Determine if
[detailed
monitoring for EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html) and
[Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-monitoring.html) is necessary. Detailed monitoring
provides one minute interval metrics, and default
monitoring provides five minute interval metrics.
- Determine if
[enhanced
monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Monitoring.html) for RDS is necessary. Enhanced
monitoring uses an agent on RDS instances to get useful
information about different process or threads.
- Determine the monitoring requirements of critical
serverless components for
[Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html),
[API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/monitoring_automated_manual.html),
[Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-observe.html),
[Amazon ECS](https://catalog.workshops.aws/observability/en-US/aws-managed-oss/amp/ecs),
and all types of
[load
balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-monitoring.html).
- Determine the monitoring requirements of storage
components for
[Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/monitoring-overview.html),
[Amazon FSx](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/monitoring_overview.html),
[Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/monitoring_overview.html),
and
[Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html).

- Create
[custom
metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) to measure business key performance
indicators (KPIs). Workloads implement key business
functions, which should be used as KPIs that help identify
when an indirect problem happens.
- Monitor the user experience for failures using user
canaries.
[Synthetic
transaction testing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) (also known as canary testing,
but not to be confused with canary deployments) that can run
and simulate customer behavior is among the most important
testing processes. Run these tests constantly against your
workload endpoints from diverse remote locations.
- Create
[custom
metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) that track the user's experience. If you can
instrument the experience of the customer, you can determine
when the consumer experience degrades.
- [Set
alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) to detect when any part of your workload is
not working properly and to indicate when to automatically
scale resources. Alarms can be visually displayed on
dashboards, send alerts through Amazon SNS or email, and
work with Auto Scaling to scale workload resources up or
down.
- Create
[dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html)
to visualize your metrics. Dashboards can be used to
visually see trends, outliers, and other indicators of
potential problems or to provide an indication of problems
you may want to investigate.
- Create
[distributed
tracing monitoring](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/faqs/) for your services. With
distributed monitoring, you can understand how your
application and its underlying services are performing to
identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance
issues and errors.
- Create monitoring systems (using
[CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_xaxr_dashboard.html)
or
[X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/faqs/))
dashboards and data collection in a separate Region and
account.
- Stay informed about service degradations with [AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/). [Create purpose-fit AWS Health event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/user-notifications.html) to e-mail and chat channels through [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html) and integrate programmatically with [your monitoring and alerting tools through Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html).

# REL11-BP02 Fail over to healthy resources

If a resource failure occurs, healthy resources should continue to
serve requests. For location impairments (such as Availability Zone
or AWS Region), ensure that you have systems in place to fail over
to healthy resources in unimpaired locations.

When designing a service, distribute load across resources,
Availability Zones, or Regions. Therefore, failure of an individual
resource or impairment can be mitigated by shifting traffic to
remaining healthy resources. Consider how services are discovered
and routed to in the event of a failure.

Design your services with fault recovery in mind. At AWS, we design
services to minimize the time to recover from failures and impact on
data. Our services primarily use data stores that acknowledge
requests only after they are durably stored across multiple replicas
within a Region. They are constructed to use cell-based isolation
and use the fault isolation provided by Availability Zones. We use
automation extensively in our operational procedures. We also
optimize our replace-and-restart functionality to recover quickly
from interruptions.

The patterns and designs that allow for the failover vary for each
AWS platform service. Many AWS native managed services are natively
multiple Availability Zone (like Lambda or API Gateway). Other AWS
services (like EC2 and EKS) require specific best practice designs to
support failover of resources or data storage across AZs.

Monitoring should be set up to check that the failover resource is
healthy, track the progress of the resources failing over, and
monitor business process recovery.

**Desired outcome:** Systems are
capable of automatically or manually using new resources to recover
from degradation.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Planning for failure is not part of the planning and design
phase.
- RTO and RPO are not established.
- Insufficient monitoring to detect failing resources.
- Proper isolation of failure domains.
- Multi-Region fail over is not considered.
- Detection for failure is too sensitive or aggressive when
deciding to failover.
- Not testing or validating failover design.
- Performing auto healing automation, but not notifying that
healing was needed.
- Lack of dampening period to avoid failing back too soon.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** You can build more resilient systems that maintain reliability when
experiencing failures by degrading gracefully and recovering
quickly.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

AWS services, such as [Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-subnets.html) and [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html), help distribute load across resources and Availability
Zones. Therefore, failure of an individual resource (such as an
EC2 instance) or impairment of an Availability Zone can be
mitigated by shifting traffic to remaining healthy resources.

For multi-Region workloads, designs are more complicated. For
example, cross-Region read replicas allow you to deploy your data
to multiple AWS Regions. However, failover is still required to
promote the read replica to primary and then point your traffic to
the new endpoint. Amazon Route 53, [Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/), Amazon CloudFront, and
AWS Global Accelerator can help route traffic across AWS Regions.

AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS,
Amazon SES, Amazon Pinpoint, Amazon ECR, AWS Certificate Manager, EventBridge, or Amazon DynamoDB, are
automatically deployed to multiple Availability Zones by AWS. In
case of failure, these AWS services automatically route traffic to
healthy locations. Data is redundantly stored in multiple
Availability Zones and remains available.

For Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EKS, or Amazon ECS, Multi-AZ is a
configuration option. AWS can direct traffic to the healthy
instance if failover is initiated. This failover action may be
taken by AWS or as required by the customer

For Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ECS tasks, or Amazon EKS pods, you choose which Availability Zones to deploy to. For
some designs, Elastic Load Balancing provides the solution to
detect instances in unhealthy zones and route traffic to the
healthy ones. Elastic Load Balancing can also route traffic to
components in your on-premises data center.

For Multi-Region traffic failover, rerouting can leverage Amazon
Route 53, Amazon Application Recovery Controller, AWS Global Accelerator, Route 53 Private DNS for VPCs, or
CloudFront to provide a way to define internet domains and assign
routing policies, including health checks, to route traffic to
healthy Regions. AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP
addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application,
then route to endpoints in AWS Regions of your choosing, using the
AWS global network instead of the internet for better performance
and reliability.

### Implementation steps

- Create failover designs for all appropriate applications and
services. Isolate each architecture component and create
failover designs meeting RTO and RPO for each component.
- Configure lower environments (like development or test) with all services that are
required to have a failover plan. Deploy the solutions using
infrastructure as code (IaC) to ensure repeatability.
- Configure a recovery site such as a second Region to implement and test the failover
designs. If necessary, resources for testing can be
configured temporarily to limit additional costs.
- Determine which failover plans are automated by AWS, which
can be automated by a DevOps process, and which might be
manual. Document and measure each service's RTO and RPO.
- Create a failover playbook and include all steps to failover
each resource, application, and service.
- Create a failback playbook and include all steps to failback
(with timing) each resource, application, and service
- Create a plan to initiate and rehearse the playbook. Use
simulations and chaos testing to test the playbook steps and
automation.
- For location impairment (such as Availability Zone or AWS Region), ensure you have systems in place to fail over to
healthy resources in unimpaired locations. Check quota,
autoscaling levels, and resources running before failover
testing.

# REL11-BP03 Automate healing on all layers

Upon detection of a failure, use automated capabilities to perform
actions to remediate. Degradations may be automatically healed
through internal service mechanisms or require resources to be
restarted or removed through remediation actions.

For self-managed applications and cross-Region healing, recovery
designs and automated healing processes can be pulled from
[existing
best practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understand-resiliency-patterns-and-trade-offs-to-architect-efficiently-in-the-cloud/).

The ability to restart or remove a resource is an important tool to
remediate failures. A best practice is to make services stateless
where possible. This prevents loss of data or availability on
resource restart. In the cloud, you can (and generally should)
replace the entire resource (for example, a compute instance or
serverless function) as part of the restart. The restart itself is a
simple and reliable way to recover from failure. Many different
types of failures occur in workloads. Failures can occur in
hardware, software, communications, and operations.

Restarting or retrying also applies to network requests. Apply the
same recovery approach to both a network timeout and a dependency
failure where the dependency returns an error. Both events have a
similar effect on the system, so rather than attempting to make
either event a special case, apply a similar strategy of limited
retry with exponential backoff and jitter. Ability to restart is a
recovery mechanism featured in recovery-oriented computing and high
availability cluster architectures.

**Desired outcome:** Automated actions are performed to remediate detection of a failure.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Provisioning resources without autoscaling.
- Deploying applications in instances or containers individually.
- Deploying applications that cannot be deployed into multiple
locations without using automatic recovery.
- Manually healing applications that automatic scaling and
automatic recovery fail to heal.
- No automation to failover databases.
- Lack automated methods to reroute traffic to new endpoints.
- No storage replication.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automated healing can reduce your mean time to recovery and improve
your availability.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Designs for Amazon EKS or other Kubernetes services should include both
minimum and maximum replica or stateful sets and the minimum
cluster and node group sizing. These mechanisms provide a minimum
amount of continually-available processing resources while
automatically remediating any failures using the Kubernetes
control plane.

Design patterns that are accessed through a load balancer using
compute clusters should leverage Auto Scaling groups. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming
application traffic across multiple targets and virtual
appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

Clustered compute-based designs that do not use load balancing
should have their size designed for loss of at least one node.
This will allow for the service to maintain itself running in
potentially reduced capacity while it's recovering a new node.
Example services are Mongo, DynamoDB Accelerator, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR,
Cassandra, Kafka, MSK-EC2, Couchbase, ELK, and Amazon OpenSearch Service.
Many of these services can be designed with additional auto
healing features. Some cluster technologies must generate an
alert upon the loss a node triggering an automated or manual
workflow to recreate a new node. This workflow can be automated
using AWS Systems Manager to remediate issues quickly.

Amazon EventBridge can be used to monitor and filter for events
such as CloudWatch alarms or changes in state in other AWS
services. Based on event information, it can then invoke AWS Lambda, Systems Manager Automation, or other targets to run
custom remediation logic on your workload. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can be configured to check for EC2 instance health. If
the instance is in any state other than running, or if the
system status is impaired, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling considers the
instance to be unhealthy and launches a replacement instance.
For large-scale replacements (such as the loss of an entire
Availability Zone), static stability is preferred for high
availability.

### Implementation steps

- Use Auto Scaling groups to deploy tiers in a workload.
[Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/plans/userguide/how-it-works.html) can perform self-healing on stateless
applications and add or remove capacity.
- For compute instances noted previously, use
[load
balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html) and choose the appropriate type of load
balancer.
- Consider healing for Amazon RDS. With standby instances, configure
for
[auto
failover](https://repost.aws/questions/QU4DYhqh2yQGGmjE_x0ylBYg/what-happens-after-failover-in-rds) to the standby instance. For Amazon RDS Read
Replica, automated workflow is required to make a read
replica primary.
- Implement
[automatic
recovery on EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html) that have applications
deployed that cannot be deployed in multiple locations, and
can tolerate rebooting upon failures. Automatic recovery can
be used to replace failed hardware and restart the instance
when the application is not capable of being deployed in
multiple locations. The instance metadata and associated IP
addresses are kept, as well as the
[EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html) and mount points to
[Amazon Elastic File System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html) or
[File
Systems for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html) and
[Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/what-is.html).
Using
[AWS OpsWorks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-autohealing.html), you can configure automatic healing of EC2
instances at the layer level.
- Implement automated recovery using
[AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) and
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) when you cannot use automatic scaling or
automatic recovery, or when automatic recovery fails. When
you cannot use automatic scaling, and either cannot use
automatic recovery or automatic recovery fails, you can
automate the healing using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda.
- [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-eventbridge.html) can be used to monitor and filter for
events such as
[CloudWatch
alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) or changes in state in other AWS services.
Based on event information, it can then invoke AWS Lambda
(or other targets) to run custom remediation logic on your
workload.

# REL11-BP04 Rely on the data plane and not the control plane during recovery

Control planes provide the administrative APIs used to create, read and describe, update, delete, and list (CRUDL) resources, while data planes handle day-to-day service traffic. When implementing recovery or mitigation responses to potentially resiliency-impacting events, focus on using a minimal number of control plane operations to recover, rescale, restore, heal, or failover the service. Data plane action should supersede any activity during these degradation events.

For example, the following are all control plane actions: launching a new compute instance, creating block storage, and describing queue services. When you launch compute instances, the control plane has to perform multiple tasks like finding a physical host with capacity, allocating network interfaces, preparing local block storage volumes, generating credentials, and adding security rules. Control planes tend to be complicated orchestration.

**Desired outcome:** When a resource enters an impaired state, the system is capable of automatically or manually recovering by shifting traffic from impaired to healthy resources.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Dependence on changing DNS records to re-route traffic.
- Dependence on control-plane scaling operations to replace impaired components due to insufficiently provisioned resources.
- Relying on extensive, multi service, multi-API control plane actions to remediate any category of impairment.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Increased success rate for automated remediation can reduce your mean time to recovery and improve availability of the workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium: For certain types of service degradations, control planes are affected. Dependencies on extensive use of the control plane for remediation may increase recovery time (RTO) and mean time to recovery (MTTR).

## Implementation guidance

To limit data plane actions, assess each service for what actions are required to restore service.

Leverage Amazon Application Recovery Controller to shift the DNS traffic. These features continually monitor your application’s ability to recover from failures and allow you to control your application recovery across multiple AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and on premises.

Route 53 routing policies use the control plane, so do not rely on it for recovery. The Route 53 data planes answer DNS queries and perform and evaluate health checks. They are globally distributed and designed for a [100% availability service level agreement (SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/sla/).

The Route 53 management APIs and consoles where you create, update, and delete Route 53 resources run on control planes that are designed to prioritize the strong consistency and durability that you need when managing DNS. To achieve this, the control planes are located in a single Region: US East (N. Virginia). While both systems are built to be very reliable, the control planes are not included in the SLA. There could be rare events in which the data plane’s resilient design allows it to maintain availability while the control planes do not. For disaster recovery and failover mechanisms, use data plane functions to provide the best possible reliability.

Design your compute infrastructure to be statically stable to avoid using the control plane during an incident. For example, if you are using Amazon EC2 instances, avoid provisioning new instances manually or instructing Auto Scaling Groups to add instances in response. For the highest levels of resilience, provision sufficient capacity in the cluster used for failover. If this capacity threshold must be limited, set throttles on the overall end-to-end system to safely limit the total traffic reaching the limited set of resources.

For services like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, load balancers, and AWS Lambda serverless, using those services leverages the data plane. However, creating new functions, load balancers, API gateways, or DynamoDB tables is a control plane action and should be completed before the degradation as preparation for an event and rehearsal of failover actions. For Amazon RDS, data plane actions allow for access to data.

For more information about data planes, control planes, and how AWS builds services to meet high availability targets, see [Static stability using Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/).

Understand which operations are on the data plane and which are on the control plane.

### Implementation steps

For each workload that needs to be restored after a degradation event, evaluate the failover runbook, high availability design, auto healing design, or HA resource restoration plan. Identity each action that might be considered a control plane action.

Consider changing the control action to a data plane action:

- Auto Scaling (control plane) to pre-scaled Amazon EC2 resources (data plane)
- Amazon EC2 instance scaling (control plane) to AWS Lambda scaling (data plane)
- Assess any designs using Kubernetes and the nature of the control plane actions. Adding pods is a data plane action in Kubernetes. Actions should be limited to adding pods and not adding nodes. Using [over-provisioned nodes](https://www.eksworkshop.com/docs/autoscaling/compute/cluster-autoscaler/overprovisioning/) is the preferred method to limit control plane actions

Consider alternate approaches that allow for data plane actions to affect the same remediation.

- Route 53 Record change (control plane) or Amazon Application Recovery Controller (data plane)
- [Route 53 Health checks for more automated updates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/creating-disaster-recovery-mechanisms-using-amazon-route-53/)

Consider some services in a secondary Region, if the service is mission critical, to allow for more control plane and data plane actions in an unaffected Region.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EKS in a primary Region compared to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EKS in a secondary Region and routing traffic to secondary Region (control plane action)
- Make read replica in secondary primary or attempting same action in primary Region (control plane action)

# REL11-BP05 Use static stability to prevent bimodal behavior

Workloads should be statically stable and only operate in a single
normal mode. Bimodal behavior is when your workload exhibits
different behavior under normal and failure modes.

For example, you might try and recover from an Availability Zone
failure by launching new instances in a different Availability Zone.
This can result in a bimodal response during a failure mode. You
should instead build workloads that are statically stable and
operate within only one mode. In this example, those instances
should have been provisioned in the second Availability Zone before
the failure. This static stability design verifies that the workload
only operates in a single mode.

**Desired outcome:** Workloads do not exhibit bimodal behavior during normal and failure
modes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Assuming resources can always be provisioned regardless of the
failure scope.
- Trying to dynamically acquire resources during a failure.
- Not provisioning adequate resources across zones or Regions until a
failure occurs.
- Considering static stable designs for compute resources only.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Workloads running with statically stable designs are capable of
having predictable outcomes during normal and failure events.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Bimodal behavior occurs when your workload exhibits different
behavior under normal and failure modes (for example, relying on
launching new instances if an Availability Zone fails). An example
of bimodal behavior is when stable Amazon EC2 designs provision enough
instances in each Availability Zone to handle the workload load if
one AZ were removed. Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon Route 53
health would check to shift a load away from the impaired
instances. After traffic has shifted, use AWS Auto Scaling to
asynchronously replace instances from the failed zone and launch
them in the healthy zones. Static stability for compute deployment
(such as EC2 instances or containers) results in the highest
reliability.

*Static stability of EC2 instances across
Availability Zones*

This must be weighed against the cost for this model and the
business value of maintaining the workload under all resilience
cases. It's less expensive to provision less compute capacity and
rely on launching new instances in the case of a failure, but for
large-scale failures (such as an Availability Zone or Regional
impairment), this approach is less effective because it relies on
both an operational plane, and sufficient resources being
available in the unaffected zones or Regions.

Your solution should also weigh reliability against the costs
needs for your workload. Static stability architectures apply to a
variety of architectures including compute instances spread across
Availability Zones, database read replica designs, Kubernetes
(Amazon EKS) cluster designs, and multi-Region failover architectures.

It is also possible to implement a more statically stable design
by using more resources in each zone. By adding more zones, you
reduce the amount of additional compute you need for static
stability.

An example of bimodal behavior would be a network timeout that
could cause a system to attempt to refresh the configuration state
of the entire system. This would add an unexpected load to another
component and might cause it to fail, resulting in other
unexpected consequences. This negative feedback loop impacts the
availability of your workload. Instead, you can build systems that
are statically stable and operate in only one mode. A statically
stable design would do constant work and always refresh the
configuration state on a fixed cadence. When a call fails, the
workload would use the previously cached value and initiate an
alarm.

Another example of bimodal behavior is allowing clients to bypass
your workload cache when failures occur. This might seem to be a
solution that accommodates client needs but it can significantly
change the demands on your workload and is likely to result in
failures.

Assess critical workloads to determine what workloads require
this type of resilience design. For those that are deemed
critical, each application component must be reviewed. Example
types of services that require static stability evaluations are:

- **Compute**: Amazon EC2, EKS-EC2,
ECS-EC2, EMR-EC2
- **Databases**: Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS,
Amazon Aurora
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 (Single Zone),
Amazon EFS (mounts), Amazon FSx (mounts)
- **Load balancers:** Under certain
designs

### Implementation steps

- Build systems that are statically stable and operate in
only one mode. In this case, provision enough instances in
each Availability Zone or Region to handle the workload
capacity if one Availability Zone or Region were removed.
A variety of services can be used for routing to healthy
resources, such as:

[Cross
Region DNS Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/cross-region-dns-based-load-balancing-and-failover.html)
- [MRAP
Amazon S3 MultiRegion Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPointRequestRouting.html)
- [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/)
- [Amazon Application Recovery Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html)

- Configure
[database
read replicas](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/) to account for the loss of a single
primary instance or a read replica. If traffic is being
served by read replicas, the quantity in each Availability
Zone and each Region should equate to the overall need in
case of the zone or Region failure.
- Configure critical data in Amazon S3 storage that is designed to
be statically stable for data stored in case of an
Availability Zone failure. If
[Amazon S3
One Zone-IA](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/announcing-s3-one-zone-infrequent-access-a-new-amazon-s3-storage-class/) storage class is used, this should not
be considered statically stable, as the loss of that zone
minimizes access to this stored data.
- [Load
balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/disable-cross-zone.html) are sometimes configured incorrectly or
by design to service a specific Availability Zone. In this
case, the statically stable design might be to spread a
workload across multiple AZs in a more complex design. The
original design may be used to reduce interzone traffic
for security, latency, or cost reasons.

# REL11-BP06 Send notifications when events impact availability

Notifications are sent upon the detection of thresholds breached,
even if the event causing the issue was automatically resolved.

Automated healing allows your workload to be reliable. However, it
can also obscure underlying problems that need to be addressed.
Implement appropriate monitoring and events so that you can detect
patterns of problems, including those addressed by auto healing, so
that you can resolve root cause issues.

Resilient systems are designed so that degradation events are
immediately communicated to the appropriate teams. These
notifications should be sent through one or many communication
channels.

**Desired outcome:**Alerts are
immediately sent to operations teams when thresholds are breached,
such as error rates, latency, or other critical key performance
indicator (KPI) metrics, so that these issues are resolved as soon as
possible and user impact is avoided or minimized.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Sending too many alarms.
- Sending alarms that are not actionable.
- Setting alarm thresholds too high (over sensitive) or too low
(under sensitive).
- Not sending alarms for external dependencies.
- Not considering
[gray
failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/advanced-multi-az-resilience-patterns/gray-failures.html) when designing monitoring and alarms.
- Performing healing automation, but not notifying the appropriate
team that healing was needed.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Notifications of recovery make operational and
business teams aware of service degradations so that they can react
immediately to minimize both mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean
time to repair (MTTR). Notifications of recovery events also assure
that you don't ignore problems that occur infrequently.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium. Failure to implement
appropriate monitoring and events notification mechanisms can result
in failure to detect patterns of problems, including those addressed
by auto healing. A team will only be made aware of system
degradation when users contact customer service or by chance.

## Implementation guidance

When defining a monitoring strategy, a triggered alarm is a common
event. This event would likely contain an identifier for the
alarm, the alarm state (such as `IN ALARM` or `OK`), and details of
what triggered it. In many cases, an alarm event should be
detected and an email notification sent. This is an example of an
action on an alarm. Alarm notification is critical in
observability, as it informs the right people that there is an
issue. However, when action on events mature in your observability
solution, it can automatically remediate the issue without the
need for human intervention.

Once KPI-monitoring alarms have been established, alerts should be
sent to appropriate teams when thresholds are exceeded. Those
alerts may also be used to trigger automated processes that will
attempt to remediate the degradation.

For more complex threshold monitoring, composite alarms should be
considered. Composite alarms use a number of KPI-monitoring alarms
to create an alert based on operational business logic. CloudWatch
Alarms can be configured to send emails, or to log incidents in
third-party incident tracking systems using Amazon SNS integration
or Amazon EventBridge.

### Implementation steps

Create various types of alarms based on how the workloads are
monitored, such as:

- Application alarms are used to detect when
any part of your workload is not working properly.
- [Infrastructure
alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) indicate when to scale resources. Alarms
can be visually displayed on dashboards, send alerts
through Amazon SNS or email, and work with Auto Scaling to
scale workload resources in or out.
- Simple
[static
alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) can be created to monitor when a
metric breaches a static threshold for a specified number
of evaluation periods.
- [Composite
alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html) can account for complex alarms from multiple sources.
- Once the alarm has been created,
create appropriate notification events. You can directly
invoke an
[Amazon SNS
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) to send notifications and link any automation
for remediation or communication.
- Stay informed about service degradations with [AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/). [Create purpose-fit AWS Health event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/user-notifications.html) to e-mail and chat channels through [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html) and integrate programmatically with [your monitoring and alerting tools through Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html).

# REL11-BP07 Architect your product to meet availability targets and uptime service level agreements (SLAs)

Architect your product to meet availability targets and uptime service level agreements (SLAs). If you publish or privately agree to availability targets or uptime SLAs, verify that your architecture and operational processes are designed to support them.

**Desired outcome:** Each application has a defined target for availability and SLA for performance metrics, which can be monitored and maintained in order to meet business outcomes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Designing and deploying workload’s without setting any SLAs.
- SLA metrics are set too high without rationale or business requirements.
- Setting SLAs without taking into account for dependencies and their underlying SLA.
- Application designs are created without considering the Shared Responsibility Model for Resilience.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Designing applications based on key resiliency targets helps you meet business objectives and customer expectations. These objectives help drive the application design process that evaluates different technologies and considers various tradeoffs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Application designs have to account for a diverse set of requirements that are derived from business, operational, and financial objectives. Within the operational requirements, workloads need to have specific resilience metric targets so they can be properly monitored and supported. Resilience metrics should not be set or derived after deploying the workload. They should be defined during the design phase and help guide various decisions and tradeoffs.

- Every workload should have its own set of resilience metrics. Those metrics may be different from other business applications.
- Reducing dependencies can have a positive impact on availability. Each workload should consider its dependencies and their SLAs. In general, select dependencies with availability goals equal to or greater than the goals of your workload.
- Consider loosely coupled designs so your workload can operate correctly despite dependency impairment, where possible.
- Reduce control plane dependencies, especially during recovery or a degradation. Evaluate designs that are statically stable for mission critical workloads. Use resource sparing to increase the availability of those dependencies in a workload.
- Observability and instrumentation are critical for achieving SLAs by reducing Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).
- Less frequent failure (longer MTBF), shorter failure detection times (shorter MTTD), and shorter repair times (shorter MTTR) are the three factors that are used to improve availability in distributed systems.
- Establishing and meeting resilience metrics for a workload is foundational to any effective design. Those designs must factor in tradeoffs of design complexity, service dependencies, performance, scaling, and costs.

**Implementation steps**

- Review and document the workload design considering the following questions:

Where are control planes used in the workload?
- How does the workload implement fault tolerance?
- What are the design patterns for scaling, automatic scaling, redundancy, and highly available components?
- What are the requirements for data consistency and availability?
- Are there considerations for resource sparing or resource static stability?
- What are the service dependencies?

- Define SLA metrics based on the workload architecture while working with stakeholders. Consider the SLAs of all dependencies used by the workload.
- Once the SLA target has been set, optimize the architecture to meet the SLA.
- Once the design is set that will meet the SLA, implement operational changes, process automation, and runbooks that also will have focus on reducing MTTD and MTTR.
- Once deployed, monitor and report on the SLA.

## Question REL12

# REL 12 — How do you test reliability?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 5

---

# REL12-BP01 Use playbooks to investigate failures

Permit consistent and prompt responses to failure scenarios that are
not well understood, by documenting the investigation process in
playbooks. Playbooks are the predefined steps performed to identify
the factors contributing to a failure scenario. The results from any
process step are used to determine the next steps to take until the
issue is identified or escalated.

The playbook is proactive planning that you must do, to be able to
take reactive actions effectively. When failure scenarios not
covered by the playbook are encountered in production, first address
the issue (put out the fire). Then go back and look at the steps you
took to address the issue and use these to add a new entry in the
playbook.

Note that playbooks are used in response to specific incidents,
while runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes. Often,
runbooks are used for routine activities and playbooks are used to
respond to non-routine events.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Planning to deploy a workload without knowing the processes to
diagnose issues or respond to incidents.
- Unplanned decisions about which systems to gather logs and
metrics from when investigating an event.
- Not retaining metrics and events long enough to be able to
retrieve the data.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Capturing playbooks ensures that processes can
be consistently followed. Codifying your playbooks limits the
introduction of errors from manual activity. Automating playbooks
shortens the time to respond to an event by eliminating the
requirement for team member intervention or providing them
additional information when their intervention begins.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- Use playbooks to identify issues. Playbooks are documented
processes to investigate issues. Allow consistent and prompt
responses to failure scenarios by documenting processes in
playbooks. Playbooks must contain the information and guidance
necessary for an adequately skilled person to gather applicable
information, identify potential sources of failure, isolate
faults, and determine contributing factors (perform post-incident
analysis).

Implement playbooks as code. Perform your operations as code by scripting your
playbooks to ensure consistency and limit reduce errors caused by manual processes.
Playbooks can be composed of multiple scripts representing the different steps that
might be necessary to identify the contributing factors to an issue. Runbook
activities can be invoked or performed as part of playbook activities, or might prompt
to run a playbook in response to identified events.

# REL12-BP02 Perform post-incident analysis

Review customer-impacting events, and identify the contributing
factors and preventative action items. Use this information to
develop mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence. Develop
procedures for prompt and effective responses. Communicate
contributing factors and corrective actions as appropriate, tailored
to target audiences. Have a method to communicate these causes to
others as needed.

Assess why existing testing did not find the issue. Add tests for
this case if tests do not already exist.

**Desired outcome:** Your teams have a consistent and agreed upon approach to handling post-incident analysis. One mechanism is the [correction of error (COE) process](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/why-you-should-develop-a-correction-of-error-coe/). The COE process helps your teams identify, understand, and address the root causes for incidents, while also building mechanisms and guardrails to limit the probability of the same incident happening again.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Finding contributing factors, but not continuing to look deeper
for other potential problems and approaches to mitigate.
- Only identifying human error causes, and not providing any
training or automation that could prevent human errors.
- Focus on assigning blame rather than understanding the root cause, creating a culture of fear and hindering open communication
- Failure to share insights, which keeps incident analysis findings within a small group and prevents others from benefiting from the lessons learned
- No mechanism to capture institutional knowledge, thereby losing valuable insights by not preserving the lessons-learned in the form of updated best practices and resulting in repeat incidents with the same or similar root cause

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Conducting post-incident analysis and sharing
the results permits other workloads to mitigate the risk if they
have implemented the same contributing factors, and allows them to
implement the mitigation or automated recovery before an incident
occurs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Good post-incident analysis provides opportunities to propose common solutions for problems with architecture patterns that are used in other places in your systems.

A cornerstone of the COE process is documenting and addressing issues. It is recommended to define a standardized way to document critical root causes, and ensure they are reviewed and addressed. Assign clear ownership for the post-incident analysis process. Designate a responsible team or individual who will oversee incident investigations and follow-ups.

Encourage a culture that focuses on learning and improvement rather than assigning blame. Emphasize that the goal is to prevent future incidents, not to penalize individuals.

Develop well-defined procedures for conducting post-incident analyses. These procedures should outline the steps to be taken, the information to be collected, and the key questions to be addressed during the analysis. Investigate incidents thoroughly, going beyond immediate causes to identify root causes and contributing factors. Use techniques like the *[five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)* to delve deep into the underlying issues.

Maintain a repository of lessons learned from incident analyses. This institutional knowledge can serve as a reference for future incidents and prevention efforts. Share findings and insights from post-incident analyses, and consider holding open-invite post-incident review meetings to discuss lessons learned.

### Implementation steps

- While conducting post-incident analysis, ensure the process is blame-free. This allows people involved in the incident to be dispassionate about the proposed corrective actions and promote honest self-assessment and collaboration across teams.
- Define a standardized way to document critical issues. An example structure for such document is as follows:

What happened?
- What was the impact on customers and your business?
- What was the root cause?
- What data do you have to support this?

For example, metrics and graphs

- What were the critical pillar implications, especially security?

When architecting workloads, you make trade-offs between pillars based upon your business context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities. You might optimize to reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs. Security is always job zero, as you have to protect your customers.

- What lessons did you learn?
- What corrective actions are you taking?

Action items
- Related items

- Create well-defined standard operating procedures for conducting post-incident analyses.
- Set up a standardized incident reporting process. Document all incidents comprehensively, including the initial incident report, logs, communications, and actions taken during the incident.
- Remember that an incident does not require an outage. It could be a near-miss, or a system performing in an unexpected way while still fulfilling its business function.
- Continually improve your post-incident analysis process based on feedback and lessons learned.
- Capture key findings in a knowledge management system, and consider any patterns that should be added to developer guides or pre-deployment checklists.

# REL12-BP03 Test scalability and performance requirements

Use techniques such as load testing to validate that the workload
meets scaling and performance requirements.

In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment for
your workload on demand. Instead of reliance on a scaled-down test
environment, which could lead to inaccurate predictions of
production behaviors, you can use the cloud to provision a test
environment that closely mirrors your expected production
environment. This environment helps you test in a more accurate
simulation of the real-world conditions your application faces.

Alongside your performance testing efforts, it's essential to
validate that your base resources, scaling settings, service quotas,
and resiliency design operate as expected under load. This holistic
approach verifies that your application can reliably scale and
perform as required, even under the most demanding conditions.

**Desired outcome:** Your workload
maintains its expected behavior even while subject to peak load. You
proactively address any performance-related issues that may arise as
the application grows and evolves.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You use test environments that do not closely match the
production environment.
- You treat load testing as a separate, one-time activity rather
than an integrated part of the deployment continuous integration
(CI) pipeline.
- You don't define clear and measurable performance requirements,
such as response time, throughput, and scalability targets.
- You perform tests with unrealistic or insufficient load
scenarios, and you fail to test for peak loads, sudden spikes,
and sustained high load.
- You don't stress test the workload by exceeding expected load
limits.
- You use inadequate or inappropriate load testing and performance
profiling tools.
- You lack comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to track
performance metrics and detect anomalies.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Load testing helps you identify potential performance
bottlenecks in your system before it goes into production. When
you simulate production-level traffic and workloads, you can
identify areas where your system may struggle to handle the
load, such as slow response times, resource constraints, or
system failures.
- As you test your system under various load conditions, you can
better understand the resource requirements needed to support
your workload. This information can help you make informed
decisions about resource allocation and prevent
over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources.
- To identify potential failure points, you can observe how your
workload performs under high load conditions. This information
helps you improve your workload's reliability and resiliency by
implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms, failover strategies,
and redundancy measures, as appropriate.
- You identify and address performance issues early, which helps
you avoid the costly consequences of system outages, slow
response times, and dissatisfied users.
- Detailed performance data and profiling information collected
during testing can help you troubleshoot performance-related
issues that may arise in production. This can lead to faster
incident response and resolution, which reduces the impact on
users and your organization's operations.
- In certain industries, proactive performance testing can help
your workload meet compliance standards, which reduces the risk
of penalties or legal issues.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

The first step is to define a comprehensive testing strategy that
covers all aspects of scaling and performance requirements. To
start, clearly define your workload's service-level objectives
(SLOs) based on your business needs, such as throughput, latency
histogram, and error rate. Next, design a suite of tests that can
simulate various load scenarios that range from average usage to
sudden spikes and sustained peak loads, and verify that the
workload's behavior meets your SLOs. These tests should be
automated and integrated into your continuous integration and
deployment pipeline to catch performance regressions early in the
development process.

To effectively test scaling and performance, invest in the right
tools and infrastructure. This includes load testing tools that
can generate realistic user traffic, performance profiling tools
to identify bottlenecks, and monitoring solutions to track key
metrics. Importantly, you should verify that your test
environments closely match the production environment in terms of
infrastructure and environment conditions to make your test
results as accurate as possible. To make it easier to reliably
replicate and scale production-like setups, use infrastructure as
code and container-based applications.

Scaling and performance tests are an ongoing process, not a
one-time activity. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
to track the application's performance in production, and use this
data to continually refine your test strategies and optimization
efforts. Regularly analyze performance data to identify emerging
issues, test new scaling strategies, and implement optimizations
to improve the application's efficiency and reliability. When you
adopt an iterative approach and constantly learn from production
data, you can verify that your application can adapt to variable
user demands and maintain resiliency and optimal performance over
time.

### Implementation steps

- Establish clear and measurable performance requirements,
such as response time, throughput, and scalability targets.
These requirements should be based on your workload's usage
patterns, user expectations, and business needs.
- Select and configure a load testing tool that can accurately
mimic the load patterns and user behavior in your production
environment.
- Set up a test environment that closely matches the
production environment, including infrastructure and
environment conditions, to improve the accuracy of your test
results.
- Create a test suite that covers a wide range of scenarios,
from average usage patterns to peak loads, rapid spikes, and
sustained high loads. Integrate the tests into your
continuous integration and deployment pipelines to catch
performance regressions early in the development process.
- Conduct load testing to simulate real-world user traffic and
understand how your application behaves under different load
conditions. To stress test your application, exceed the
expected load and observe its behavior, such as response
time degradation, resource exhaustion, or system failures,
which helps identify the breaking point of your application
and inform scaling strategies. Evaluate the scalability of
your workload by incrementally increasing the load, and
measure the performance impact to identify scaling limits
and plan for future capacity needs.
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to track
performance metrics, detect anomalies, and initiate scaling
actions or notifications when thresholds are exceeded.
- Continually monitor and analyze performance data to identify
areas for improvement. Iterate on your testing strategies
and optimization efforts.

# REL12-BP04 Test resiliency using chaos engineering

Run chaos experiments regularly in environments that are in or as close to production as possible to understand how your system responds to adverse conditions.

**Desired outcome:**

The resilience of the workload is regularly verified by applying chaos engineering in the form of fault injection experiments or injection of unexpected load,
in addition to resilience testing that validates known expected behavior of your workload during an event. Combine both chaos engineering and resilience testing
to gain confidence that your workload can survive component failure and can recover from unexpected disruptions with minimal to no impact.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Designing for resiliency, but not verifying how the workload functions as a whole when
faults occur.
- Never experimenting under real-world conditions and expected load.
- Not treating your experiments as code or maintaining them through the development cycle.
- Not running chaos experiments both as part of your CI/CD pipeline, as well as outside of deployments.
- Neglecting to use past post-incident analyses when determining which faults to experiment with.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Injecting faults to
verify the resilience of your workload allows you to gain confidence that the recovery procedures of
your resilient design will work in the case of a real fault.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Chaos engineering provides your teams with capabilities to continually inject real world
disruptions (simulations) in a controlled way at the service provider, infrastructure, workload,
and component level, with minimal to no impact to your customers. It allows your teams to learn
from faults and observe, measure, and improve the resilience of your workloads, as well as validate
that alerts fire and teams get notified in the case of an event.

When performed continually, chaos engineering can highlight deficiencies in your workloads that,
if left unaddressed, could negatively affect availability and operation.

Note
Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build
confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. –
[Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/)

If a system is able to withstand these disruptions, the chaos experiment should be maintained
as an automated regression test. In this way, chaos experiments should be performed as part of
your systems development lifecycle (SDLC) and as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

To ensure that your workload can survive component failure, inject real world events as part of
your experiments. For example, experiment with the loss of Amazon EC2 instances or failover of the primary
Amazon RDS database instance, and verify that your workload is not impacted (or only minimally impacted).
Use a combination of component faults to simulate events that may be caused by a disruption in an Availability Zone.

For application-level faults (such as crashes), you can start with stressors such as memory and CPU exhaustion.

To validate [fallback or failover mechanisms](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/)
for external dependencies due to intermittent network disruptions, your components should simulate such an event by blocking access to the
third-party providers for a specified duration that can last from seconds to hours.

Other modes of degradation might cause reduced functionality and slow responses, often resulting in a disruption of your services.
Common sources of this degradation are increased latency on critical services and unreliable network communication (dropped packets).
Experiments with these faults, including networking effects such as latency, dropped messages, and DNS failures, could include the
inability to resolve a name, reach the DNS service, or establish connections to dependent services.

**Chaos engineering tools:**

AWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS) is a fully managed service for running fault injection
experiments that can be used as part of your CD pipeline, or outside of the pipeline. AWS FIS is a
good choice to use during chaos engineering game days. It supports simultaneously introducing
faults across different types of resources including Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Amazon RDS.
These faults include termination of resources, forcing failovers, stressing CPU or memory, throttling,
latency, and packet loss. Since it is integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Alarms, you can set up stop
conditions as guardrails to rollback an experiment if it causes unexpected impact.

*AWS Fault Injection Service integrates with AWS
resources to allow you to run fault injection experiments for your
workloads.*

There are also several third-party options for fault injection experiments. These include
open-source tools such as [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/), [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/), and [Litmus Chaos](https://litmuschaos.io/), as well as commercial options like Gremlin. To expand the scope of
faults that can be injected on AWS, AWS FIS [integrates with Chaos Mesh and Litmus Chaos](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/07/aws-fault-injection-simulator-supports-chaosmesh-litmus-experiments/), allowing you to coordinate fault
injection workflows among multiple tools. For example, you can run a stress test on a pod’s
CPU using Chaos Mesh or Litmus faults while terminating a randomly selected percentage of
cluster nodes using AWS FIS fault actions.

## Implementation steps

- Determine which faults to use for experiments.

Assess the design of your workload for resiliency. Such designs (created using the best
practices of the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)) account for risks based on critical dependencies,
past events, known issues, and compliance requirements. List each element of the design
intended to maintain resilience and the faults it is designed to mitigate. For more
information about creating such lists, see the [Operational Readiness Review whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/wa-operational-readiness-reviews.html) which guides you on how to
create a process to prevent reoccurrence of previous incidents. The Failure Modes and
Effects Analysis (FMEA) process provides you with a framework for performing a component-level
analysis of failures and how they impact your workload. FMEA is outlined in more detail by
Adrian Cockcroft in [Failure Modes and Continuous Resilience](https://adrianco.medium.com/failure-modes-and-continuous-resilience-6553078caad5).
- Assign a priority to each fault.

Start with a coarse categorization such as high, medium, or low.
To assess priority, consider frequency of the fault and impact of failure to the overall workload.

When considering frequency of a given fault, analyze past data for this workload when available.
If not available, use data from other workloads running in a similar environment.

When considering impact of a given fault, the larger the scope of the fault, generally the larger the impact.
Also consider the workload design and purpose. For example, the ability to access the source data stores is
critical for a workload doing data transformation and analysis. In this case, you would prioritize experiments
for access faults, as well as throttled access and latency insertion.

Post-incident analyses are a good source of data to understand both frequency and impact of failure modes.

Use the assigned priority to determine which faults to experiment with first
and the order with which to develop new fault injection experiments.
- For each experiment that you perform, follow the chaos engineering and continuous resilience flywheel in the following figure.

*Chaos engineering and continuous resilience flywheel, using the scientific method by Adrian Hornsby.*

Define steady state as some measurable output of a workload that indicates normal behavior.

Your workload exhibits steady state if it is operating reliably and as expected. Therefore, validate that your
workload is healthy before defining steady state. Steady state does not necessarily mean no impact to the workload
when a fault occurs, as a certain percentage in faults could be within acceptable limits. The steady state is
your baseline that you will observe during the experiment, which will highlight anomalies if your hypothesis
defined in the next step does not turn out as expected.

For example, a steady state of a payments system can be defined as the processing of 300 TPS with a success rate
of 99% and round-trip time of 500 ms.
- Form a hypothesis about how the workload will react to the fault.

A good hypothesis is based on how the workload is expected to mitigate the fault to maintain the steady state.
The hypothesis states that given the fault of a specific type, the system or workload will continue steady state,
because the workload was designed with specific mitigations. The specific type of fault and mitigations should be
specified in the hypothesis.

The following template can be used for the hypothesis (but other wording is also acceptable):

Note
If `specific fault` occurs, the `workload name` workload will `describe mitigating controls` to maintain
`business or technical metric impact`.

For example:

If 20% of the nodes in the Amazon EKS node-group are taken down, the Transaction Create API continues to serve the 99th percentile of
requests in under 100 ms (steady state). The Amazon EKS nodes will recover within five minutes, and pods will get scheduled and process
traffic within eight minutes after the initiation of the experiment. Alerts will fire within three minutes.
- If a single Amazon EC2 instance failure occurs, the order system’s Elastic Load Balancing health check will cause the Elastic Load Balancing
to only send requests to the remaining healthy instances while the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces the failed instance, maintaining a
less than 0.01% increase in server-side (5xx) errors (steady state).
- If the primary Amazon RDS database instance fails, the Supply Chain data collection workload will failover and connect to the standby
Amazon RDS database instance to maintain less than 1 minute of database read or write errors (steady state).

- Run the experiment by injecting the fault.

An experiment should by default be fail-safe and tolerated by the workload. If
you know that the workload will fail, do not run the experiment. Chaos engineering
should be used to find known-unknowns or unknown-unknowns. *Known-unknowns* are things you are aware of but don’t fully understand,
and *unknown-unknowns* are things you are neither
aware of nor fully understand. Experimenting against a workload that you know is
broken won’t provide you with new insights. Your experiment should be carefully
planned, have a clear scope of impact, and provide a rollback mechanism that can be
applied in case of unexpected turbulence. If your due-diligence shows that your
workload should survive the experiment, move forward with the
experiment. There are several options for injecting the faults. For workloads on
AWS, [AWS FIS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is.html) provides many predefined fault simulations called [actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/actions.html). You
can also define custom actions that run in AWS FIS using [AWS Systems Manager
documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-ssm-docs.html).

We discourage the use of custom scripts for chaos experiments, unless the scripts
have the capabilities to understand the current state of the workload, are able to emit logs,
and provide mechanisms for rollbacks and stop conditions where possible.

An effective framework or toolset which supports chaos engineering should track
the current state of an experiment, emit logs, and provide rollback mechanisms to
support the controlled running of an experiment. Start with an established service
like AWS FIS that allows you to perform experiments with a clearly defined scope and
safety mechanisms that rollback the experiment if the experiment introduces unexpected
turbulence. To learn about a wider variety of experiments using AWS FIS, also see the
[Resilient and Well-Architected Apps with Chaos Engineering lab](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/44e29d0c-6c38-4ef3-8ff3-6d95a51ce5ac/en-US). Also,
[AWS Resilience Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/what-is.html) will
analyze your workload and create experiments that you can choose to implement and run
in AWS FIS.

Note
For every experiment, clearly understand the scope and its impact. We recommend that
faults should be simulated first on a non-production environment before being run in production.

Experiments should run in production under real-world load using
[canary deployments](https://medium.com/the-cloud-architect/chaos-engineering-q-a-how-to-safely-inject-failure-ced26e11b3db)
that spin up both a control and experimental system deployment, where feasible. Running experiments during off-peak times is a good
practice to mitigate potential impact when first experimenting in production. Also, if
using actual customer traffic poses too much risk, you can run experiments using
synthetic traffic on production infrastructure against the control and experimental
deployments. When using production is not possible, run experiments in pre-production
environments that are as close to production as possible.

You must establish and monitor guardrails to ensure the experiment does not
impact production traffic or other systems beyond acceptable limits. Establish stop
conditions to stop an experiment if it reaches a threshold on a guardrail metric that
you define. This should include the metrics for steady state for the workload, as well
as the metric against the components into which you’re injecting the fault. A [synthetic monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html)
(also known as a user canary) is one metric you should
usually include as a user proxy. [Stop conditions for AWS FIS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/stop-conditions.html)
are supported as part of the experiment template, allowing up to five stop-conditions per template.

One of the principles of chaos is minimize the scope of the experiment and its impact:

While there must be an allowance for some short-term negative impact, it is the responsibility and
obligation of the Chaos Engineer to ensure the fallout from experiments are minimized and contained.

A method to verify the scope and potential impact is to perform the experiment in a non-production environment
first, verifying that thresholds for stop conditions activate as expected during an experiment and observability
is in place to catch an exception, instead of directly experimenting in production.

When running fault injection experiments, verify that all responsible parties are well-informed. Communicate with
appropriate teams such as the operations teams, service reliability teams, and customer support to let them know
when experiments will be run and what to expect. Give these teams communication tools to inform those running the
experiment if they see any adverse effects.

You must restore the workload and its underlying systems back to the original known-good state. Often, the resilient
design of the workload will self-heal. But some fault designs or failed experiments can leave your workload in an
unexpected failed state. By the end of the experiment, you must be aware of this and restore the workload and systems.
With AWS FIS you can set a rollback configuration (also called a post action) within the action parameters. A post action
returns the target to the state that it was in before the action was run. Whether automated (such as using AWS FIS) or
manual, these post actions should be part of a playbook that describes how to detect and handle failures.
- Verify the hypothesis.

[Principles of Chaos
Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) gives this guidance on how to verify steady state of your
workload:
Focus on the measurable output of a system, rather than internal attributes of the system.
Measurements of that output over a short period of time constitute a proxy for the system’s steady state.
The overall system’s throughput, error rates, and latency percentiles could all be metrics of interest
representing steady state behavior. By focusing on systemic behavior patterns during experiments, chaos engineering verifies
that the system does work, rather than trying to validate how it works.

In our two previous examples, we include the steady state metrics of less than 0.01% increase in server-side (5xx) errors and
less than one minute of database read and write errors.

The 5xx errors are a good metric because they are a consequence of the failure mode that a client of the workload will experience directly.
The database errors measurement is good as a direct consequence of the fault, but should also be supplemented with a client impact measurement
such as failed customer requests or errors surfaced to the client. Additionally, include a synthetic monitor (also known as a user canary) on
any APIs or URIs directly accessed by the client of your workload.
- Improve the workload design for resilience.

If steady state was not maintained, then investigate how the workload design can
be improved to mitigate the fault, applying the best practices of the [AWS Well-Architected
Reliability pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html). Additional guidance and resources can be found in the
[AWS Builder’s Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/),
which hosts articles about how to [improve your health
checks](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/implementing-health-checks/) or [employ retries with
backoff in your application code](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/), among others.

After these changes have been implemented, run the experiment again (shown by the dotted line in the chaos engineering flywheel)
to determine their effectiveness. If the verify step indicates the hypothesis holds true, then the workload
will be in steady state, and the cycle continues.

- Run experiments regularly.

A chaos experiment is a cycle, and experiments should be run regularly as part of
chaos engineering. After a workload meets the experiment’s hypothesis, the experiment
should be automated to run continually as a regression part of your CI/CD pipeline. To
learn how to do this, see this blog on [how to run AWS FIS experiments using AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/chaos-testing-with-aws-fault-injection-simulator-and-aws-codepipeline/). This lab on recurrent [AWS FIS
experiments in a CI/CD pipeline](https://chaos-engineering.workshop.aws/en/030_basic_content/080_cicd.html) allows you to work hands-on.
Fault injection experiments are also a part of game days (see [REL12-BP05 Conduct game days regularly](./rel_testing_resiliency_game_days_resiliency.html)).
Game days simulate a failure or event to verify systems, processes, and team responses.
The purpose is to actually perform the actions the team would perform as if an exceptional event happened.
- Capture and store experiment results.

Results for fault injection experiments must be captured and persisted. Include all
necessary data (such as time, workload, and conditions) to be able to later
analyze experiment results and trends. Examples of results might include screenshots of
dashboards, CSV dumps from your metric’s database, or a hand-typed record of events and
observations from the experiment. [Experiment logging with AWS FIS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/monitoring-logging.html)
can be part of this data capture.

# REL12-BP05 Conduct game days regularly

Conduct game days to regularly exercise your procedures for
responding to workload-impacting events and impairments. Involve the
same teams who would be responsible for handling production
scenarios. These exercises help enforce measures to prevent user
impact caused by production events. When you practice your response
procedures in realistic conditions, you can identify and address any
gaps or weaknesses before a real event occurs.

Game days simulate events in production-like environments to test
systems, processes, and team responses. The purpose is to perform
the same actions the team would perform as if the event actually
occurred. These exercises help you understand where improvements can
be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing
with events and impairments. These should be conducted regularly so
that your team knows builds ingrained habits for how to respond.

Game days prepare teams to handle production events with greater
confidence. Teams that are well-practiced are more able to quickly
detect and respond to various scenarios. This results in a
significantly improved readiness and resilience posture.

**Desired outcome:** You run
resilience game days on a consistent, scheduled basis. These game
days are seen as a normal and expected part of doing business. Your
organization has built a culture of preparedness, and when
production issues occur, your teams are well-prepared to respond
effectively, resolve the issues efficiently, and mitigate the impact
on customers.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You document your procedures, but your never exercise them.
- You exclude business decision makers in the test exercises.
- You run a game day, but you don't inform all relevant
stakeholders.
- You focus solely on technical failures, but you don't involve
business stakeholders.
- You don't incorporate lessons learned from game days into your
recovery processes.
- You blame teams for failures or bugs.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Enhance response skills: On game days, teams practice their
duties and test their communication mechanisms during simulated
events, which creates a more coordinated and efficient response
in production situations.
- Identify and address dependencies: Complex environments often
involve intricate dependencies between various systems,
services, and components. Game days can help you identify and
address these dependencies, and verify that your critical
systems and services are properly covered by your runbook
procedures and can be scaled up or recovered in a timely manner.
- Foster a culture of resilience: Game days can help cultivate a
mindset of resilience within an organization. When you involve
cross-functional teams and stakeholders, these exercises promote
awareness, collaboration, and a shared understanding of the
importance of resilience across the entire organization.
- Continuous improvement and adaptation: Regular game days help
you to continually assess and adapt your resilience strategies,
which keeps them relevant and effective in the face of changing
circumstances.
- Increase confidence in the system: Successful game days can help
you build confidence in the system's ability to withstand and
recover from disruptions.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Once you have designed and implemented the necessary resilience
measures, conduct a game day to validate that everything works as
planned in production. A game day, especially the first one,
should involve all team members, and all stakeholders and
participants should be informed in advance about the date, time,
and simulated scenarios.

During the game day, the involved teams simulate various events
and potential scenarios according to the prescribed procedures.
The participants closely monitor and assess the impact of these
simulated events. If the system operates as designed, the
automated detection, scaling, and self-healing mechanisms should
activate and result in little to no impact on users. If the team
observes any negative impact, they roll back the test and remedy
the identified issues, either through automated means or manual
intervention documented in the applicable runbooks.

To continuously improve resilience, it's critical to document and
incorporate lessons learned. This process is a *feedback
loop* that systematically captures insights from game
days and uses them to enhance systems, processes, and team
capabilities.

To help you reproduce real-world scenarios where system components
or services may fail unexpectedly, inject simulated faults as a
game day exercise. Teams can test the resilience and fault
tolerance of their systems and simulate their incident response
and recovery processes in a controlled environment.

In AWS, your game days can be carried out with replicas of your
production environment using infrastructure as code. Through this
process, you can test in a safe environment that closely resembles
your production environment. Consider
[AWS Fault Injection Service](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) to create different failure scenarios. Use
services like
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and
[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/)
to monitor system behavior during game days. Use
[AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) to manage and run playbooks, and use
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) to orchestrate recurring game day workflows.

### Implementation steps

- **Establish a game day
program:** Develop a structured program that
defines the frequency, scope and objectives of game days.
Involve key stakeholders and subject matter experts in
planning and running these exercises.
- **Prepare the game day:**

Identify the key business-critical services that are the
focus of the game day. Catalog and map the people,
processes, and technologies that support those services.
- Set the agenda for the game day, and prepare the
involved teams to participate in the event. Prepare your
automation services to simulate the planned scenarios
and run the appropriate recovery processes. AWS services
such as
[AWS Fault Injection Service](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/),
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), and
[AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) can help you automate various
aspects of game days, such as injection of faults and
initiation of recovery actions.

- **Run your simulation:** On
the game day, run the planned scenario. Observe and document
how the people, processes, and technologies react to the
simulated event.
- **Conduct post-exercise
reviews:** After the game day, conduct a
retrospective session to review the lessons learned.
Identify areas for improvement and any actions needed to
improve operational resilience. Document your findings, and
track any necessary changes to enhance your resilience
strategies and preparedness to completion.

## Question REL13

# REL 13 — How do you plan for disaster recovery (DR)?

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 5

---

# REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss

Failures can impact your business in several ways. First, failures
can cause service interruption (downtime). Second, failures can
cause data to become lost, inconsistent, or stale. In order to guide
how you respond and recover from failures, define a Recovery Time
Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each
workload. *Recovery Time Objective (RTO)* is the
maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and
restoration of service. *Recovery Point Objective
(RPO)*  is the maximum acceptable time after the last data
recovery point.

**Desired outcome:** Every workload has a designated RTO and RPO based on technical
considerations and business impact.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You haven't designated recovery objectives.
- You select arbitrary recovery objectives.
- You select recovery objectives that are too lenient and do not
meet business objectives.
- You have not evaluated the impact of downtime and data loss.
- You select unrealistic recovery objectives, such as zero time to
recover or zero data loss, which may not be achievable for your
workload configuration.
- You select recovery objectives that are more stringent than
actual business objectives. This forces recovery implementations
that are costlier and more complicated than what the workload
needs.
- You select recovery objectives that are incompatible with those
of a dependent workload.
- You fail to consider regulatory and compliance requirements.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When you set RTOs and RPOs for your workloads,
you establish clear and measurable goals for recovery based on your
business needs. Once you've set those goals, you can create disaster
recovery (DR) plans that are tailored to meet them.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice

Construct a matrix or worksheet to help guide your disaster
recovery planning. In your matrix, create different workload
categories or tiers based on their business impact (such as
critical, high, medium, and low) and the associated RTOs and RPOs
to target for each one. The following matrix provides an example
(note that your RTO and RPO values may differ) you can follow:

*Example disaster recovery matrix*

For each workload, investigate and understand the impact of
downtime and lost data on your business. The impact typically
grows with downtime and data loss, but the shape of the impact can
differ based on the workload type. For example, downtime for up to
an hour might have low impact, but after that, the impact could
quickly intensify. Impact can take many forms, including financial
impact (such as lost revenue), reputational impact (including loss
of customer trust), operational impact (such as a missed payroll
or decreased productivity), and regulatory risk. Once completed,
assign the workload to the appropriate tier.

Consider the following questions when you analyze the impact of
failure:

- What is the maximum time the workload can be unavailable
before unacceptable impact to the business is incurred?
- How much impact, and what kind, will be incurred by the
business by a workload disruption? Consider all kinds of
impact, including financial, reputational, operational, and
regulatory.
- What is the maximum amount of data that can be lost or
unrecoverable before unacceptable impact to the business is
incurred?
- Can lost data be recreated from other sources (also known as
*derived* data)? If so, also consider the
RPOs of all source data used to recreate the workload data.
- What are the recovery objectives and availability expectations
of workloads that this one depends on (downstream)? Your
workload's objectives must be achievable given the recovery
capabilities of its downstream dependencies. Consider possible
downstream dependency workarounds or mitigations that can
improve this workload's recovery capability.
- What are the recovery objectives and availability expectations
of workloads that depend on this one (upstream)? Upstream
workload objectives may require this workload to have more
stringent recovery capabilities than it first appears.
- Are there different recovery objectives based on the type of
incident? For example, you might have different RTOs and RPOs
depending on whether the incident impacts an Availability Zone
or an entire Region.
- Do your recovery objectives change during certain events or
times of the year? For example, you might have different RTOs
and RPOs around holiday shopping seasons, sporting events,
special sales, and new product launches.
- How do the recovery objectives align with any line of business
and organizational disaster recovery strategy you might have?
- Are there legal or contractual ramifications to consider? For
example, are you contractually obligated to provide a service
with a given RTO or RPO? What penalties might you incur for
not meeting them?
- Are you required to maintain data integrity to meet regulatory
or compliance requirements?

The following worksheet can aid your evaluation of each workload.
You may modify this worksheet to suit your specific needs, such as
adding additional questions.

*Worksheet*

### Implementation steps

- Identify the business stakeholders and technical teams
responsible for each workload, and engage with them.
- Create categories or tiers of criticality for workload
impact in your organization. Example categories include
critical, high, medium, and low. For each category, choose
an RTO and RPO that reflects your business objectives and
requirements.
- Assign one of the impact categories you created in the
previous step to each workload. To decide how a workload
maps to a category, consider the workload's importance to
the business and the impact of interruption or data loss,
and use the questions above to guide you. This results in an
RTO and RPO for each workload.
- Consider the RTO and RPO for each workload determined in the
previous step. Involve the workload's business and technical
teams to determine whether the objectives should be
adjusted. For example, business stakeholders could determine
that more stringent targets are required. Alternatively,
technical teams could determine that targets should be
modified to make them achievable with available resources
and technological constraints.

# REL13-BP02 Use defined recovery strategies to meet the recovery objectives

Define a disaster recovery (DR) strategy that meets your workload's recovery objectives. Choose a strategy such as backup and restore, standby (active/passive), or active/active.

**Desired outcome:** For each workload, there is a defined and implemented DR strategy
that allows the workload to achieve DR objectives. DR strategies
between workloads make use of reusable patterns (such as the
strategies previously described),

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing inconsistent recovery procedures for workloads with
similar DR objectives.
- Leaving the DR strategy to be implemented ad-hoc when a disaster
occurs.
- Having no plan for disaster recovery.
- Dependency on control plane operations during recovery.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Using defined recovery strategies allows you to use common
tooling and test procedures.
- Using defined recovery strategies improves knowledge sharing between teams and implementation of DR on
the workloads they own.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High. Without a planned, implemented, and tested DR strategy, you are
unlikely to achieve recovery objectives in the event of a
disaster.

## Implementation guidance

A DR strategy relies on the ability to stand up your workload in a
recovery site if your primary location becomes unable to run the
workload. The most common recovery objectives are RTO and RPO, as
discussed in [REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss](./rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html).

A DR strategy across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a
single AWS Region, can provide mitigation against disaster events
like fires, floods, and major power outages. If it is a requirement
to implement protection against an unlikely event that prevents your
workload from being able to run in a given AWS Region, you can use a
DR strategy that uses multiple Regions.

When architecting a DR strategy across multiple Regions, you should
choose one of the following strategies. They are listed in
increasing order of cost and complexity, and decreasing order of RTO
and RPO. *Recovery Region* refers to an AWS Region other than the primary one used for your workload.

*Figure 17: Disaster recovery (DR) strategies*

- **Backup and restore** (RPO in
hours, RTO in 24 hours or less): Back up your data and
applications into the recovery Region. Using automated or
continuous backups will permit point in time recovery (PITR), which can
lower RPO to as low as 5 minutes in some cases. In the event of
a disaster, you will deploy your infrastructure (using
infrastructure as code to reduce RTO), deploy your code, and
restore the backed-up data to recover from a disaster in the
recovery Region.
- **Pilot light** (RPO in minutes,
RTO in tens of minutes): Provision a copy of your core workload
infrastructure in the recovery Region. Replicate your data into
the recovery Region and create backups of it there. Resources
required to support data replication and backup, such as
databases and object storage, are always on. Other elements such
as application servers or serverless compute are not deployed,
but can be created when needed with the necessary configuration
and application code.
- **Warm standby** (RPO in seconds,
RTO in minutes): Maintain a scaled-down but fully functional
version of your workload always running in the recovery Region.
Business-critical systems are fully duplicated and are always
on, but with a scaled down fleet. Data is replicated and live in
the recovery Region. When the time comes for recovery, the
system is scaled up quickly to handle the production load. The
more scaled-up the warm standby is, the lower RTO and control
plane reliance will be. When fully scales this is known as
*hot standby*.
- **Multi-Region (multi-site)
active-active** (RPO near zero, RTO potentially zero):
Your workload is deployed to, and actively serving traffic from,
multiple AWS Regions. This strategy requires you to synchronize
data across Regions. Possible conflicts caused by writes to the
same record in two different regional replicas must be avoided
or handled, which can be complex. Data replication is useful for
data synchronization and will protect you against some types of
disaster, but it will not protect you against data corruption or
destruction unless your solution also includes options for
point-in-time recovery.

Note
The difference between pilot light and warm standby can sometimes be difficult to
understand. Both include an environment in your recovery Region with copies of your primary
region assets. The distinction is that pilot light cannot process requests without additional
action taken first, while warm standby can handle traffic (at reduced capacity levels)
immediately. Pilot light will require you to turn on servers, possibly deploy additional
(non-core) infrastructure, and scale up, while warm standby only requires you to scale up
(everything is already deployed and running). Choose between these based on your RTO and RPO
needs.

When cost is a concern, and you wish to achieve a similar RPO and RTO objectives as defined in the warm standby strategy, you could consider cloud native solutions, like AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery, that take the pilot light approach and offer improved RPO and RTO targets.

**Implementation steps**

- **Determine a DR strategy that will
satisfy recovery requirements for this workload.**

Choosing a DR strategy is a trade-off between reducing downtime and data loss (RTO
and RPO) and the cost and complexity of implementing the strategy. You should avoid
implementing a strategy that is more stringent than it needs to be, as this incurs
unnecessary costs.
For example, in the following diagram, the business has determined their maximum
permissible RTO as well as the limit of what they can spend on their service restoration
strategy. Given the business’ objectives, the DR strategies pilot light or warm standby
will satisfy both the RTO and the cost criteria.

*Figure 18: Choosing a DR strategy based on RTO and
cost*

To learn more, see [Business Continuity Plan (BCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/business-continuity-plan-bcp.html).
- **Review the patterns for how the selected DR strategy can be
implemented.**

This step is to understand how you will implement the selected strategy. The
strategies are explained using AWS Regions as the primary and recovery sites. However,
you can also choose to use Availability Zones within a single Region as your DR strategy,
which makes use of elements of multiple of these strategies.
In the following steps, you can apply the strategy to your specific workload.

**Backup and restore**

*Backup and restore* is the least complex strategy to implement, but
will require more time and effort to restore the workload, leading to higher RTO and RPO.
It is a good practice to always make backups of your data, and copy these to another site
(such as another AWS Region).

*Figure 19: Backup and restore architecture*

For more details on this strategy see [Disaster Recovery (DR) Architecture on AWS, Part II: Backup and Restore with Rapid
Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-ii-backup-and-restore-with-rapid-recovery/).

**Pilot light**

With the *pilot light* approach, you replicate your data from your
primary Region to your recovery Region. Core resources used for the workload
infrastructure are deployed in the recovery Region, however additional resources and any
dependencies are still needed to make this a functional stack. For example, in Figure 20,
no compute instances are deployed.

*Figure 20: Pilot light architecture*

For more details on this strategy, see [Disaster Recovery (DR) Architecture on AWS, Part III: Pilot Light and Warm
Standby](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/).

**Warm standby**

The *warm standby* approach involves ensuring that there is a
scaled down, but fully functional, copy of your production environment in another Region.
This approach extends the pilot light concept and decreases the time to recovery because
your workload is always-on in another Region. If the recovery Region is deployed at full
capacity, then this is known as *hot standby*.

*Figure 21: Warm standby architecture*

Using warm standby or pilot light requires scaling up resources in the recovery
Region. To verify capacity is available when needed, consider the use for [capacity reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) for EC2 instances. If using AWS Lambda, then [provisioned
concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) can provide runtime environments so that they are prepared to
respond immediately to your function's invocations.
For more details on this strategy, see [Disaster Recovery (DR) Architecture on AWS, Part III: Pilot Light and Warm
Standby](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/).

**Multi-site active/active**

You can run your workload simultaneously in multiple Regions as part of
a *multi-site active/active* strategy. Multi-site active/active
serves traffic from all regions to which it is deployed. Customers may select this
strategy for reasons other than DR. It can be used to increase availability, or when
deploying a workload to a global audience (to put the endpoint closer to users and/or to
deploy stacks localized to the audience in that region). As a DR strategy, if the workload
cannot be supported in one of the AWS Regions to which it is deployed, then that Region
is evacuated, and the remaining Regions are used to maintain availability. Multi-site
active/active is the most operationally complex of the DR strategies, and should only be
selected when business requirements necessitate it.

*Figure 22: Multi-site active/active architecture*

For more details on this strategy, see [Disaster Recovery (DR) Architecture on AWS, Part IV: Multi-site
Active/Active](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iv-multi-site-active-active/).

**AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery**

If you are considering the pilot light or warm standby strategy for disaster
recovery, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery could provide an alternative approach with improved benefits. Elastic Disaster Recovery
can offer an RPO and RTO target similar to warm standby, but maintain the low-cost
approach of pilot light. Elastic Disaster Recovery replicates your data from your primary region to your
recovery Region, using continual data protection to achieve an RPO measured in seconds and
an RTO that can be measured in minutes. Only the resources required to replicate the data
are deployed in the recovery region, which keeps costs down, similar to the pilot light
strategy. When using Elastic Disaster Recovery, the service coordinates and orchestrates the recovery of
compute resources when initiated as part of failover or drill.

*Figure 23: AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery architecture*

**Additional practices for protecting data**

With all strategies, you must also mitigate against a data disaster. Continuous data
replication protects you against some types of disaster, but it may not protect you
against data corruption or destruction unless your strategy also includes versioning of
stored data or options for point-in-time recovery. You must also back up the replicated
data in the recovery site to create point-in-time backups in addition to the replicas.

**Using multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a single
AWS Region**

When using multiple AZs within a single Region, your DR implementation uses multiple
elements of the above strategies. First you must create a high-availability (HA)
architecture, using multiple AZs as shown in Figure 23. This architecture makes use of a
multi-site active/active approach, as the [Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-availability-zones) and the [Elastic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html#availability-zones) have resources deployed in multiple AZs, actively handing
requests. The architecture also demonstrates hot standby, where if the primary [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html) instance fails (or the AZ itself fails), then the standby instance is
promoted to primary.

*Figure 24: Multi-AZ architecture*

In addition to this HA architecture, you need to add backups of all data required to
run your workload. This is especially important for data that is constrained to a single
zone such as [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes.html) or [Amazon Redshift clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html). If an
AZ fails, you will need to restore this data to another AZ. Where possible, you should
also copy data backups to another AWS Region as an additional layer of protection.
An less common alternative approach to single Region, multi-AZ DR is illustrated in
the blog post, [Building highly resilient applications using Amazon Application Recovery Controller,
Part 1: Single-Region stack](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/building-highly-resilient-applications-using-amazon-route-53-application-recovery-controller-part-1-single-region-stack/). Here, the strategy is to maintain as much isolation
between the AZs as possible, like how Regions operate. Using this alternative strategy,
you can choose an active/active or active/passive approach.
NoteSome workloads have regulatory data residency requirements. If this applies to your
workload in a locality that currently has only one AWS Region, then multi-Region will
not suit your business needs. Multi-AZ strategies provide good protection against most
disasters.
- **Assess the resources of your workload, and what their configuration
will be in the recovery Region prior to failover (during normal operation).**

For infrastructure and AWS resources use infrastructure as code such as [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) or third-party tools like
Hashicorp Terraform. To deploy across multiple accounts and Regions with a single
operation you can use [AWS CloudFormation
StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html). For Multi-site active/active and Hot Standby strategies, the deployed
infrastructure in your recovery Region has the same resources as your primary Region. For
Pilot Light and Warm Standby strategies, the deployed infrastructure will require
additional actions to become production ready. Using CloudFormation [parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html) and [conditional logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-conditions.html), you can control whether a deployed stack is active or
standby with [a single template](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/). When using Elastic Disaster Recovery, the service will replicate and orchestrate
the restoration of application configurations and compute resources.
All DR strategies require that data sources are backed up within the AWS Region,
and then those backups are copied to the recovery Region. [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) provides a centralized view where you can configure,
schedule, and monitor backups for these resources. For Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and
Multi-site active/active, you should also replicate data from the primary Region to data
resources in the recovery Region, such as [Amazon Relational Database Service
(Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) DB instances or [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) tables. These data resources are therefore live and ready to serve
requests in the recovery Region.
To learn more about how AWS services operate across Regions, see this blog series
on [Creating a Multi-Region Application with AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/tag/creating-a-multi-region-application-with-aws-services-series/).
- **Determine and implement how you will make your recovery Region ready
for failover when needed (during a disaster event).**

For multi-site active/active, failover means evacuating a Region, and relying on the
remaining active Regions. In general, those Regions are ready to accept traffic. For Pilot
Light and Warm Standby strategies, your recovery actions will need to deploy the missing
resources, such as the EC2 instances in Figure 20, plus any other missing resources.
For all of the above strategies you may need to promote read-only instances of
databases to become the primary read/write instance.
For backup and restore, restoring data from backup creates resources for that data
such as EBS volumes, RDS DB instances, and DynamoDB tables. You also need to restore the
infrastructure and deploy code. You can use AWS Backup to restore data in the recovery
Region. See [REL09-BP01 Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources](./rel_backing_up_data_identified_backups_data.html) for more details.
Rebuilding the infrastructure includes creating resources like EC2 instances in addition
to the [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc), subnets, and security
groups needed. You can automate much of the restoration process. To learn how, see [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-ii-backup-and-restore-with-rapid-recovery/).
- **Determine and implement how you will reroute traffic to failover
when needed (during a disaster event).**

This failover operation can be initiated either automatically or manually.
Automatically initiated failover based on health checks or alarms should be used with
caution since an unnecessary failover (false alarm) incurs costs such as non-availability
and data loss. Manually initiated failover is therefore often used. In this case, you
should still automate the steps for failover, so that the manual initiation is like the
push of a button.
There are several traffic management options to consider when using AWS services.
One option is to use [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53). Using
Amazon Route 53, you can associate multiple IP endpoints in one or more AWS Regions with
a Route 53 domain name. To implement manually initiated failover you can use [Amazon
Application Recovery Controller](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/), which provides a highly available data plane
API to reroute traffic to the recovery Region. When implementing failover, use data plane
operations and avoid control plane ones as described in [REL11-BP04 Rely on the data plane and not the control plane during recovery](./rel_withstand_component_failures_avoid_control_plane.html).
To learn more about this and other options see [this section of the Disaster Recovery Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html#pilot-light).
- **Design a plan for how your workload will fail back.**

Failback is when you return workload operation to the primary Region, after a
disaster event has abated. Provisioning infrastructure and code to the primary Region
generally follows the same steps as were initially used, relying on infrastructure as code
and code deployment pipelines. The challenge with failback is restoring data stores, and
ensuring their consistency with the recovery Region in operation.
In the failed over state, the databases in the recovery Region are live and have the
up-to-date data. The goal then is to re-synchronize from the recovery Region to the
primary Region, ensuring it is up-to-date.
Some AWS services will do this automatically. If using [Amazon DynamoDB global tables](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/), even if the table in the
primary Region had become not available, when it comes back online, DynamoDB resumes
propagating any pending writes. If using [Amazon Aurora Global Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/global-database/) and using [managed planned failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover), then Aurora global database's existing replication
topology is maintained. Therefore, the former read/write instance in the primary Region
will become a replica and receive updates from the recovery Region.
In cases where this is not automatic, you will need to re-establish the database in
the primary Region as a replica of the database in the recovery Region. In many cases this
will involve deleting the old primary database, and creating new replicas.
After a failover, if you can continue running in your recovery Region, consider
making this the new primary Region. You would still do all the above steps to make the
former primary Region into a recovery Region. Some organizations do a scheduled rotation,
swapping their primary and recovery Regions periodically (for example every three months).
All of the steps required to fail over and fail back should be maintained in a
playbook that is available to all members of the team, and is periodically reviewed.
When using Elastic Disaster Recovery, the service will assist in orchestrating and automating the
failback process. For more details, see [Performing a failback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/failback-performing-main.html).

# REL13-BP03 Test disaster recovery implementation to validate the implementation

Regularly test failover to your recovery site to verify that it operates properly and that RTO and RPO are met.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Never exercise failovers in production.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Regularly testing you disaster recovery plan
verifies that it will work when it needs to, and that your team knows
how to perform the strategy.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

A pattern to avoid is developing recovery paths that are rarely
exercised. For example, you might have a secondary data store that
is used for read-only queries. When you write to a data store and
the primary fails, you might want to fail over to the secondary data
store. If you don’t frequently test this failover, you might find
that your assumptions about the capabilities of the secondary data
store are incorrect. The capacity of the secondary, which might have
been sufficient when you last tested, might be no longer be able to
tolerate the load under this scenario. Our experience has shown that
the only error recovery that works is the path you test frequently.
This is why having a small number of recovery paths is best. You can
establish recovery patterns and regularly test them. If you have a
complex or critical recovery path, you still need to regularly
exercise that failure in production to convince yourself that the
recovery path works. In the example we just discussed, you should
fail over to the standby regularly, regardless of need.

**Implementation steps**

- Engineer your workloads for recovery. Regularly test your recovery
paths. Recovery-oriented computing identifies the
characteristics in systems that enhance recovery: isolation and redundancy, system-wide ability
to roll back changes, ability to monitor and determine health,
ability to provide diagnostics, automated recovery, modular
design, and ability to restart. Exercise the recovery path to
verify that you can accomplish the recovery in the specified time
to the specified state. Use your runbooks during this recovery to
document problems and find solutions for them before the next
test.
- For Amazon EC2-based workloads, use [AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/what-is-drs.html) to implement and launch drill instances for your DR strategy. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery provides the ability to efficiently run drills, which helps you prepare for a failover event. You can also frequently launch of your instances using Elastic Disaster Recovery for test and drill purposes without redirecting the traffic.

# REL13-BP04 Manage configuration drift at the DR site or Region

To perform a successful disaster recovery (DR) procedure, your
workload must be able to resume normal operations in a timely manner
with no relevant loss of functionality or data once the DR
environment has been brought online. To achieve this goal, it's
essential to maintain consistent infrastructure, data, and
configurations between your DR environment and the primary
environment.

**Desired outcome:** Your disaster
recovery site's configuration and data are in parity with the
primary site, which facilitates rapid and complete recovery when
needed.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You fail to update recovery locations when changes are made to
the primary locations, which results in outdated configurations
that could hinder recovery efforts.
- You do not consider potential limitations such as service
differences between primary and recovery locations, which can
lead to unexpected failures during failover.
- You rely on manual processes to update and synchronize the DR
environment, which increases the risk of human error and
inconsistency.
- You fail to detect configuration drift, which leads to a false
sense of DR site readiness prior to an incident.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Consistency between the DR environment and the
primary environment significantly improves the likelihood of a
successful recovery after an incident and reduces the risk of a
failed recovery procedure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

A comprehensive approach to configuration management and failover
readiness can help you verify that the DR site is consistently
updated and prepared to take over in the event of a primary site
failure.

To achieve consistency between your primary and disaster recovery
(DR) environments, validate that your delivery pipelines
distribute applications to both your primary and DR sites. Roll
out changes to the DR sites after an appropriate evaluation period
(also known as *staggered deployments*) to
detect problems at the primary site and halt the deployment before
they spread. Implement monitoring to detect configuration drift,
and track changes and compliance across your environments. Perform
automated remediation in the DR site to keep it fully consistent
and ready to take over in the event of an incident.

### Implementation steps

- Validate that the DR region contains the AWS services and
features required for a successful execution of your DR
plan.
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC). Keep your production
infrastructure and application configuration templates
accurate, and regularly apply them to your disaster recovery
environment.
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) can detect drift between what your
CloudFormation templates specify and what is actually
deployed.
- Configure CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications and
infrastructure updates to all environments, including
primary and DR sites. CI/CD solutions such as
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) can automate the deployment process,
which reduces the risk of configuration drift.
- Stagger deployments between the primary and DR environments.
This approach allows updates to be initially deployed and
tested in the primary environment, which isolates issues in
the primary site before they are propagated to the DR site.
This approach prevents defects from being simultaneously
pushed to production and the DR site at the same time and
maintains the integrity of the DR environment.
- Continually monitor resource configurations in both primary
and DR environments. Solutions such as
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) can help to enforce configuration compliance
and detect drift, which helps maintain the consistent
configurations across environments.
- Implement alerting mechanisms to track and notify upon any
configuration drift or data replication interruption or lag.
- Automate the remediation of detected configuration drift.
- Schedule regular audits and compliance checks to verify
ongoing alignment between primary and DR configurations.
Periodic reviews help you maintain compliance with defined
rules and identify any discrepancies that need to be
addressed.
- Check for mismatches in AWS provisioned capacity, service
quotas, throttle limits, and configuration and version
discrepancies.

# REL13-BP05 Automate recovery

Implement tested and automated recovery mechanisms that are
reliable, observable, and reproducible to reduce the risk and
business impact of failure.

**Desired outcome:** You have
implemented a well-documented, standardized, and thoroughly-tested
automation workflow for recovery processes. Your recovery automation
automatically corrects minor issues that pose low risk of data loss
or unavailability. You are able to quickly invoke recovery processes
for serious incidents, observe the remediation behavior while they
operate, and end the processes if you observe dangerous situations
or failures.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You depend on components or mechanisms that are in a failed or
degraded state as part of your recovery plan.
- Your recovery processes require manual intervention, such as
console access (also known as *click ops*).
- You automatically initiate recovery procedures in situations
that present a high risk of data loss or unavailability.
- You fail to include a mechanism to abort a recovery procedure
(like an *Andon cord* or *big red
stop button*) that is not working or that poses
additional risks.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Increased reliability, predictability, and consistency of
recovery operations.
- Ability to meet more stringent recovery objectives, including
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO).
- Reduced likelihood of recovery failing during an incident.
- Reduced risk of failures associated with manual recovery
processes that are prone to human error.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To implement automated recovery, you need a comprehensive approach
that uses AWS services and best practices. To start, identify
critical components and potential failure points in your workload.
Develop automated processes that can recover your workloads and
data from failures without human intervention.

Develop your recovery automation using infrastructure as code
(IaC) principles. This makes your recovery environment consistent
with the source environment and allows for version control of your
recovery processes. To orchestrate complex recovery workflows,
consider solutions such as
[AWS Systems Manager Automations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) or
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

Automation of recovery processes provides significant benefits and
can help you more easily achieve your Recovery Time Objective
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). However, they can
encounter unexpected situations that may cause them to fail or
create new risks of their own such as additional downtime and data
loss. To mitigate this risk, provide the ability to quickly halt a
recovery automation in progress. Once halted, you can investigate
and take corrective steps.

For supported workloads, consider solutions such as AWS Elastic
Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to provide automated failover. AWS DRS
continually replicates your machines (including operating system,
system state configuration, databases, applications, and files)
into a staging area in your target AWS account and preferred
Region. If an incident occurs, AWS DRS automates the conversion of
your replicated servers into fully-provisioned workloads in your
recovery Region on AWS.

Maintenance and improvement of automated recovery is an ongoing
process. Continually test and refine your recovery procedures
based on lessons learned, and stay updated on new AWS services and
features that can enhance your recovery capabilities.

### Implementation steps

- **Plan for automated
recovery**

Conduct a thorough review of your workload architecture,
components, and dependencies to identify and plan
automated recovery mechanisms. Categorize your
workload's dependencies into *hard*
and *soft* dependencies. Hard
dependencies are those that the workload cannot operate
without and for which no substitute can be provided.
Soft dependencies are those that the workload ordinarily
uses but are replaceable with temporary substitute
systems or processes or can be handled by
[graceful
degradation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation).
- Establish processes to identify and recover missing or
corrupted data.
- Define steps to confirm a recovered steady state after
recovery actions have been completed.
- Consider any actions required to make the recovered
system ready for full service, such as pre-warming and
populating caches.
- Consider problems that could be encountered during the
recovery process and how to detect and remediate them.
- Consider scenarios where the primary site and its
control plane are inaccessible. Verify that recovery
actions can be performed independently without reliance
on the primary site. Consider solutions such as
[Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/) to
redirect traffic without the need to manually mutate DNS
records.

- **Develop automated recovery
process**

Implement automated fault detection and failover
mechanisms for hands-free recovery. Build dashboards
such as with
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to report the progress and health of
automated recovery procedures. Include procedures to
validate successful recovery. Provide a mechanism to
abort a recovery in process.
- Build
[playbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_testing_resiliency_playbook_resiliency)
as a fallback process for faults that cannot be
automatically recovered from, and take into
consideration your
[disaster
recovery plan](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/faqs/#Core_concepts).
- Test recovery processes as discussed in
[REL13-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_for_recovery_dr_tested.html).

- **Prepare for recovery**

Evaluate the state of your recovery site and deploy
critical components to it in advance. For more detail,
see
[REL13-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_config_drift.html).
- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and
decision-making processes for recovery operations,
involving relevant stakeholders and teams across the
organization.
- Define the conditions to initiate your recovery
processes.
- Create a plan to revert the recovery process and fall
back to your primary site if required or after it's
considered safe.
