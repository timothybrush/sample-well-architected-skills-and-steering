## Question OPS01

# OPS 1 — How do you determine what your priorities are?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 6

---

# OPS01-BP01 Evaluate external customer needs

Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and
operations teams, to determine where to focus efforts on external
customer needs. This verifies that you have a thorough understanding
of the operations support that is required to achieve your desired
business outcomes.

**Desired outcome:**

- You work
backwards from customer outcomes.
- You understand how your operational practices support business
outcomes and objectives.
- You engage all relevant parties.
- You have mechanisms to capture external customer needs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You have decided not to have customer support outside of core
business hours, but you haven't reviewed historical support
request data. You do not know whether this will have an impact
on your customers.
- You are developing a new feature but have not engaged your
customers to find out if it is desired, if desired in what form,
and without experimentation to validate the need and method of
delivery.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Customers whose needs are satisfied are much
more likely to remain customers. Evaluating and understanding
external customer needs will inform how you prioritize your efforts
to deliver business value.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

**Understand business needs:** Business success is created by shared
goals and understanding across stakeholders, including business,
development, and operations teams.

**Review business goals, needs, and
priorities of external customers:** Engage key
stakeholders, including business, development, and operations
teams, to discuss goals, needs, and priorities of external
customers. This ensures that you have a thorough understanding of
the operational support that is required to achieve business and
customer outcomes.

**Establish a shared
understanding:** Establish a shared understanding of the
business functions of the workload, the roles of each of the teams
in operating the workload, and how these factors support your
shared business goals across internal and external customers.

# OPS01-BP02 Evaluate internal customer needs

Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and
operations teams, when determining where to focus efforts on
internal customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough
understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve
business outcomes.

**Desired outcome:**

- You use your
established priorities to focus your improvement efforts where they
will have the greatest impact (for example, developing team skills,
improving workload performance, reducing costs, automating runbooks,
or enhancing monitoring).
- You update your priorities as needs change.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You have
decided to change IP address allocations for your product teams,
without consulting them, to make managing your network easier. You
do not know the impact this will have on your product teams.
- You are implementing a new development tool but have not engaged
your internal customers to find out if it is needed or if it is
compatible with their existing practices.
- You are implementing a new monitoring system but have not
contacted your internal customers to find out if they have
monitoring or reporting needs that should be considered.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Evaluating and understanding internal customer
needs informs how you prioritize your efforts to deliver business
value.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- Understand business needs: Business success is created by
shared goals and understanding across stakeholders including
business, development, and operations teams.
- Review business goals, needs, and priorities of internal
customers: Engage key stakeholders, including business,
development, and operations teams, to discuss goals, needs,
and priorities of internal customers. This ensures that you
have a thorough understanding of the operational support that
is required to achieve business and customer outcomes.
- Establish shared understanding: Establish shared understanding
of the business functions of the workload, the roles of each
of the teams in operating the workload, and how these factors
support shared business goals across internal and external
customers.

# OPS01-BP03 Evaluate governance requirements

Governance is the set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to
achieve its business goals. Governance requirements are generated from within your
organization. They can affect the types of technologies you choose or influence the
way you operate your workload. Incorporate organizational governance requirements
into your workload. Conformance is the ability to demonstrate that you have implemented
governance requirements.

**Desired outcome:**

- Governance requirements are incorporated into the architectural design and operation of your workload.
- You can provide proof that you have followed governance requirements.
- Governance requirements are regularly reviewed and updated.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your organization mandates that the root account has multi-factor authentication. You failed to implement this requirement and the root account is compromised.
- During the design of your workload, you choose an instance type that is not approved by the IT department. You are unable to launch your workload and must conduct a redesign.
- You are required to have a disaster recovery plan. You did not create one and your workload suffers an extended outage.
- Your team wants to use new instances but your governance requirements have not been updated to allow them.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Following governance requirements aligns your workload with larger organization policies.
- Governance requirements reflect industry standards and best practices for your organization.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Identify governance requirement by working with stakeholders and
governance organizations. Include governance requirements into your
workload. Be able to demonstrate proof that you’ve followed governance
requirements.

**Customer example**

At AnyCompany Retail, the cloud operations team works with stakeholders
across the organization to develop governance requirements. For example,
they prohibit SSH access into Amazon EC2 instances. If teams need system access,
they are required to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. The cloud
operations team regularly updates governance requirements as new services
become available.

**Implementation steps**

- Identify the stakeholders for your workload, including any centralized teams.
- Work with stakeholders to identify governance requirements.
- Once you’ve generated a list, prioritize the improvement items, and begin implementing them into your workload.

Use services like [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/best-practices-for-aws-organizations-service-control-policies-in-a-multi-account-environment/) to create governance-as-code and validate that governance requirements are followed.
- If you use [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html), you can leverage Service Control Policies to implement governance requirements.

- Provide documentation that validates the implementation.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. Implementing missing governance requirements
may result in rework of your workload.

# OPS01-BP04 Evaluate compliance requirements

Regulatory, industry, and internal compliance requirements are an important driver for defining
your organization’s priorities. Your compliance framework may preclude you from using specific
technologies or geographic locations. Apply due diligence if no external compliance frameworks are
identified. Generate audits or reports that validate compliance.

If you advertise that your product meets specific compliance standards, you must have an internal process for ensuring continuous compliance. Examples of compliance standards include PCI DSS, FedRAMP, and HIPAA. Applicable compliance standards are determined by various factors, such as what types of data the solution stores or transmits and which geographic regions the solution supports.

**Desired outcome:**

- Regulatory, industry, and internal compliance requirements are incorporated into architectural selection.
- You can validate compliance and generate audit reports.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Parts of your workload fall under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) framework but your workload stores credit cards data unencrypted.
- Your software developers and architects are unaware of the compliance framework that your organization must adhere to.
- The yearly Systems and Organizations Control (SOC2) Type II audit is happening soon and you are unable to verify that controls are in place.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Evaluating and understanding the compliance requirements that apply to your workload will inform how you prioritize your efforts to deliver business value.
- You choose the right locations and technologies that are congruent with your compliance framework.
- Designing your workload for auditability helps you to prove you are adhering to your compliance framework.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means that you incorporate compliance requirements into your architecture design process. Your team members are aware of the required compliance framework. You validate compliance in line with the framework.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail stores credit card information for customers. Developers on the card storage team understand that they need to comply with the PCI-DSS framework. They’ve taken steps to verify that credit card information is stored and accessed securely in line with the PCI-DSS framework. Every year they work with their security team to validate compliance.

**Implementation steps**

- Work with your security and governance teams to determine what industry, regulatory, or internal compliance frameworks that your workload must adhere to. Incorporate the compliance frameworks into your workload.

Validate continual compliance of AWS resources with services like
[AWS Compute Optimizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/what-is-compute-optimizer.html)
and [AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html).

- Educate your team members on the compliance requirements so they can operate and evolve the workload in line with them. Compliance requirements should be included in architectural and technological choices.
- Depending on the compliance framework, you may be required to generate an audit or compliance report. Work with your organization to automate this process as much as possible.

Use services like [AWS Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to validate compliance and generate audit reports.
- You can download AWS security and compliance documents with [AWS Artifact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/artifact/latest/ug/what-is-aws-artifact.html).

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. Implementing compliance frameworks can be challenging. Generating audit reports or compliance documents adds additional complexity.

# OPS01-BP05 Evaluate threat landscape

Evaluate threats to the business (for example, competition, business
risk and liabilities, operational risks, and information security
threats) and maintain current information in a risk registry.
Include the impact of risks when determining where to focus efforts.

The
[Well-Architected
Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) emphasizes learning, measuring, and improving. It
provides a consistent approach for you to evaluate architectures,
and implement designs that will scale over time. AWS provides the
[AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/) to help you review your approach prior
to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and
the state of your workloads in production. You can compare them to
the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor the overall
status of your workloads, and gain insight to potential risks.

AWS customers are eligible for a guided Well-Architected Review of
their mission-critical workloads to
[measure
their architectures](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/) against AWS best practices. Enterprise
Support customers are eligible for an
[Operations
Review](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/), designed to help them to identify gaps in their
approach to operating in the cloud.

The cross-team engagement of these reviews helps to establish common
understanding of your workloads and how team roles contribute to
success. The needs identified through the review can help shape your
priorities.

[AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/) is a tool that provides access to a core set
of checks that recommend optimizations that may help shape your
priorities.
[Business
and Enterprise Support customers](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/) receive access to additional
checks focusing on security, reliability, performance, and
cost-optimization that can further help shape their priorities.

**Desired outcome:**

- You regularly
review and act on Well-Architected and Trusted Advisor outputs
- You are aware of the latest patch status of your services
- You understand the risk and impact of known threats and act
accordingly
- You implement mitigations as necessary
- You communicate actions and context

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You are
using an old version of a software library in your product. You are
unaware of security updates to the library for issues that may have
unintended impact on your workload.
- Your competitor just released a version of their product that
addresses many of your customers' complaints about your product.
You have not prioritized addressing any of these known issues.
- Regulators have been pursuing companies like yours that are not
compliant with legal regulatory compliance requirements. You
have not prioritized addressing any of your outstanding
compliance requirements.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** You identify and understand the threats to your
organization and workload, which helps your determination of which
threats to address, their priority, and the resources necessary to
do so.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- **Evaluate threat landscape:**
Evaluate threats to the business (for example, competition,
business risk and liabilities, operational risks, and
information security threats), so that you can include their
impact when determining where to focus efforts.

[AWS Latest Security Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/)
- [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/)

- **Maintain a threat model:**
Establish and maintain a threat model identifying potential
threats, planned and in place mitigations, and their priority.
Review the probability of threats manifesting as incidents,
the cost to recover from those incidents and the expected harm
caused, and the cost to prevent those incidents. Revise
priorities as the contents of the threat model change.

# OPS01-BP06 Evaluate tradeoffs while managing benefits and risks

Competing interests from multiple parties can make it challenging to
prioritize efforts, build capabilities, and deliver outcomes aligned
with business strategies. For example, you may be asked to
accelerate speed-to-market for new features over optimizing IT
infrastructure costs. This can put two interested parties in
conflict with one another. In these situations, decisions need to be
brought to a higher authority to resolve conflict. Data is required
to remove emotional attachment from the decision-making process.

The same challenge may occur at a tactical level. For example, the
choice between using relational or non-relational database
technologies can have a significant impact on the operation of an
application. It's critical to understand the predictable results of
various choices.

AWS can help you educate your teams about AWS and its services to
increase their understanding of how their choices can have an impact
on your workload. Use the resources provided by
[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/)
([AWS Knowledge Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/),
[AWS Discussion Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/index.jspa), and
[Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/)) and
[AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) to educate your teams. For further questions,
reach out to Support.

AWS also shares operational best practices and patterns in
[The
Amazon Builders' Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/). A wide variety of other useful
information is available through the
[AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/) and
[The
Official AWS Podcast](https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/).

**Desired outcome:** You have a
clearly defined decision-making governance framework to facilitate
important decisions at every level within your cloud delivery
organization. This framework includes features like a risk register,
defined roles that are authorized to make decisions, and a defined
models for each level of decision that can be made. This framework
defines in advance how conflicts are resolved, what data needs to be
presented, and how options are prioritized, so that once decisions
are made you can commit without delay. The decision-making framework
includes a standardized approach to reviewing and weighing the
benefits and risks of every decision to understand the tradeoffs.
This may include external factors, such as adherence to regulatory
compliance requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your
investors request that you demonstrate compliance with Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). You do not consider the
tradeoffs between satisfying their request and continuing with your
current development efforts. Instead, you proceed with your
development efforts without demonstrating compliance. Your investors
stop their support of your company over concerns about the security
of your platform and their investments.
- You have decided to include a library that one of your
developers found on the internet. You have not evaluated the
risks of adopting this library from an unknown source and do not
know if it contains vulnerabilities or malicious code.
- The original business justification for your migration was based
upon the modernization of 60% of your application workloads.
However, due to technical difficulties, a decision was made to
modernize only 20%, leading to a reduction in planned benefits
long-term, increased operator toil for infrastructure teams to
manually support legacy systems, and greater reliance on
developing new skillsets in your infrastructure teams that were
not planning for this change.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Fully aligning and supporting board-level
business priorities, understanding the risks to achieving success,
making informed decisions, and acting appropriately when risks
impede chances for success. Understanding the implications and
consequences of your decisions helps you to prioritize your options
and bring leaders into agreement faster, leading to improved
business outcomes. Identifying the available benefits of your
choices and being aware of the risks to your organization helps you
make data-driven decisions, rather than relying on anecdotes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Managing benefits and risks should be defined by a governing body
that drives the requirements for key decision-making. You want
decisions to be made and prioritized based on how they benefit the
organization, with an understanding of the risks involved.
Accurate information is critical for making the organizational
decisions. This should be based on solid measurements and defined
by common industry practices of cost benefit analysis. To make
these types of decisions, strike a balance between centralized and
decentralized authority. There is always a tradeoff, and it's
important to understand how each choice impacts defined strategies
and desired business outcomes.

### Implementation steps

- Formalize benefits measurement practices within a holistic
cloud governance framework.

Balance central control of decision-making with
decentralized authority for some decisions.
- Understand that burdensome decision-making processes
imposed on every decision can slow you down.
- Incorporate external factors into your decision making
process (like compliance requirements).

- Establish an agreed-upon decision-making framework for
various levels of decisions, which includes who is required
to unblock decisions that are subject to conflicted
interests.

Centralize one-way door decisions that could be
irreversible.
- Allow two-way door decisions to be made by lower level
organizational leaders.

- Understand and manage benefits and risks. Balance the
benefits of decisions against the risks involved.

**Identify benefits**:
Identify benefits based on business goals, needs, and
priorities. Examples include business case impact,
time-to-market, security, reliability, performance, and
cost.
- **Identify risks**:
Identify risks based on business goals, needs, and
priorities. Examples include time-to-market, security,
reliability, performance, and cost.
- **Assess benefits against risks
and make informed decisions**: Determine the
impact of benefits and risks based on goals, needs, and
priorities of your key stakeholders, including business,
development, and operations. Evaluate the value of the
benefit against the probability of the risk being
realized and the cost of its impact. For example,
emphasizing speed-to-market over reliability might
provide competitive advantage. However, it may result in
reduced uptime if there are reliability issues.

- Programatically enforce key decisions that automate your
adherence to compliance requirements.
- Leverage known industry frameworks and capabilities, such as
Value Stream Analysis and LEAN, to baseline current state
performance, business metrics, and define iterations of
progress towards improvements to these metrics.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium-High

## Question OPS02

# OPS 2 — How do you structure your organization to support your business outcomes?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 6

---

# OPS02-BP01 Resources have identified owners

Resources for your workload must have identified owners for change
control, troubleshooting, and other functions. Owners are assigned
for workloads, accounts, infrastructure, platforms, and
applications. Ownership is recorded using tools like a central
register or metadata attached to resources. The business value of
components informs the processes and procedures applied to them.

**Desired outcome:**

- Resources have identified owners using metadata or a central
register.
- Team members can identify who owns resources.
- Accounts have a single owner where possible.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- The alternate contacts for your AWS accounts are not populated.
- Resources lack tags that identify what teams own them.
- You have an ITSM queue without an email mapping.
- Two teams have overlapping ownership of a critical piece of
infrastructure.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Change control for resources is straightforward with assigned
ownership.
- You can involve the right owners when troubleshooting issues.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Define what ownership means for the resource use cases in your
environment. Ownership can mean who oversees changes to the
resource, supports the resource during troubleshooting, or who is
financially accountable. Specify and record owners for resources,
including name, contact information, organization, and team.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail defines ownership as the team or individual that
owns changes and support for resources. They leverage AWS Organizations to manage their AWS accounts. Alternate account
contacts are configuring using group inboxes. Each ITSM queue maps
to an email alias. Tags identify who own AWS resources. For other
platforms and infrastructure, they have a wiki page that
identifies ownership and contact information.

### Implementation steps

- Start by defining ownership for your organization. Ownership
can imply who owns the risk for the resource, who owns
changes to the resource, or who supports the resource when
troubleshooting. Ownership could also imply financial or
administrative ownership of the resource.
- Use
[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) to manage accounts. You can manage the
alternate contacts for your accounts centrally.

Using company owned email addresses and phone numbers
for contact information helps you to access them even if
the individuals whom they belong to are no longer with
your organization. For example, create separate email
distribution lists for billing, operations, and security
and configure these as Billing, Security, and Operations
contacts in each active AWS account. Multiple people
will receive AWS notifications and be able to respond,
even if someone is on vacation, changes roles, or leaves
the company.
- If an account is not managed by
[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/), alternate account contacts help
AWS get in contact with the appropriate personnel if
needed. Configure the account's alternate contacts to
point to a group rather than an individual.

- Use tags to identify owners for AWS resources. You can
specify both owners and their contact information in
separate tags.

You can use
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) rules to enforce that resources have the
required ownership tags.
- For in-depth guidance on how to build a tagging strategy
for your organization, see

- Use
[Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/), a conversational assistant that uses
generative AI to enhance workforce productivity, answer
questions, and complete tasks based on information in your
enterprise systems.

Connect Amazon Q Business to your company's data source.
Amazon Q Business offers prebuilt connectors to over 40
supported data sources, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce,
and Atlassian Confluence. For more information, see
[Amazon Q Business connectors](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/connectors/).

- For other resources, platforms, and infrastructure, create
documentation that identifies ownership. This should be
accessible to all team members.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Low. Leverage account contact information and
tags to assign ownership of AWS resources. For other resources
you can use something as simple as a table in a wiki to record
ownership and contact information, or use an ITSM tool to map
ownership.

# OPS02-BP02 Processes and procedures have identified owners

Understand who has ownership of the definition of individual
processes and procedures, why those specific process and procedures
are used, and why that ownership exists. Understanding the reasons
that specific processes and procedures are used aids in
identification of improvement opportunities.

**Desired outcome:** Your
organization has a well defined and maintained set of process and
procedures for operational tasks. The process and procedures are
stored in a central location and available to your team members.
Process and procedures are updated frequently, by clearly assigned
ownership. Where possible, scripts, templates, and automation
documents are implemented as code.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Processes are not documented. Fragmented scripts may exist on
isolated operator workstations.
- Knowledge of how to use scripts is held by a few individuals or
informally as team knowledge.
- A legacy process is due for an update, but ownership of the
update is unclear, and the original author is no longer part of
the organization.
- Processes and scripts are not discoverable, so they are not
readily available when required (for example, in response to an
incident).

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Processes and procedures boost your efforts to operate your
workloads.
- New team members become effective more quickly.
- Reduced time to mitigate incidents.
- Different team members (and teams) can use the same processes
and procedures in a consistent manner.
- Teams can scale their processes with repeatable processes.
- Standardized processes and procedures help mitigate the impact
of transferring workload responsibilities between teams.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- Processes and procedures have identified owners who are
responsible for their definition.

Identify the operations activities conducted in support of
your workloads. Document these activities in a
discoverable location.
- Uniquely identify the individual or team responsible for
the specification of an activity. They are responsible to
verify that it can be successfully performed by an
adequately skilled team member with the correct
permissions, access, and tools. If there are issues with
performing that activity, the team members performing it
are responsible for providing the detailed feedback
necessary for the activity to be improved.
- Capture ownership in the metadata of the activity artifact
through services like AWS Systems Manager, through
documents, and AWS Lambda. Capture resource ownership
using tags or resource groups, specifying ownership and
contact information. Use AWS Organizations to create
tagging polices and capture ownership and contact
information.

- Over time, these procedures should be evolved to be runnable
as code, reducing the need for human intervention.

For example, consider AWS Lambda functions, CloudFormation
templates, or AWS Systems Manager automation docs.
- Perform version control in appropriate repositories.
- Include suitable resource tagging so owners and
documentation can readily be identified.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail defines ownership as the team or individual that
owns processes for an application or groups of applications (that
share common architetural practices and technologies). Initially,
the process and procedures are documented as step-by-step guides
in the document management system, discoverable using tags on the
AWS account that hosts the application and on specific groups of
resources within the account. They leverage AWS Organizations to
manage their AWS accounts. Over time, these processes are
converted to code, and resources are defined using infrastructure
as code (such as CloudFormation or AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
templates). The operational processes become automation documents
in AWS Systems Manager or AWS Lambda functions, which can be
initiated as scheduled tasks, in response to events such as AWS
CloudWatch alarms or AWS EventBridge events, or started by
requests within an IT service management (ITSM) platform. All
process have tags to identify ownership. Documentation for the
automation and process is maintained within the wiki pages
generated by the code repository for the process.

### Implementation steps

- Document the existing processes and procedures.

Review and keep them up-to-date.
- Identify an owner for each process or procedure.
- Place them under version control.
- Where possible, share processes and procedures across
workloads and environments that share architectural
designs.

- Establish mechanisms for feedback and improvement.

Define policies for how frequently processes should be
reviewed.
- Define processes for reviewers and approvers.
- Implement issues or a ticketing queue for feedback to be
provided and tracked.
- Whereever possible, processes and procedures should have
pre-approval and risk classification from a change
approval board (CAB).

- Verify that processes and procedures are accessible and
discoverable by those who need to run them.

Use tags to indicate where the process and procedures
can be accessed for the workload.
- Use meaningful error and event messaging to indicate the
appropriate processes or procedures to address an issue.
- Use wikis and document management, and make processes
and procedures searchable consistently accross the
organization.

- Use [Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/), a conversational assistant that uses generative AI to enhance workforce productivity, answer questions, and complete tasks based on information in your enterprise systems.

Connect Amazon Q Business to your company's data source. Amazon Q Business offers prebuilt connectors to over 40 supported data sources, including Amazon S3, Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, and Atlassian Confluence. For more information, see [Amazon Q connectors](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/connectors/).

- Automate when appropriate.

Automations should be developed when services and
technologies provide an API.
- Educate adequately on processes. Develop the user
stories and requirements to automate those processes.
- Measure the use of your processes and procedures
successfully, and create issues or tickets to support iterative
improvement.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

# OPS02-BP03 Operations activities have identified owners responsible for their performance

Understand who has responsibility to perform specific activities on
defined workloads and why that responsibility exists. Understanding
who has responsibility to perform activities informs who will
conduct the activity, validate the result, and provide feedback to
the owner of the activity.

**Desired outcome:**

Your organization clearly defines responsibilities to perform
specific activities on defined workloads and respond to events
generated by the workload. The organization documents ownership of
processes and fulfillment and makes this information discoverable.
You review and update responsibilities when organizational changes
take place, and teams track and measure the performance of defect
and inefficiency identification activities. You implement feedback
mechanisms to track defects and improvements and support iterative
improvement.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You do not document responsibilities.
- Fragmented scripts exist on isolated operator workstations.
Only a few individuals know how to use them or informally refer
to them as *team knowledge*.
- A legacy process is due for update, but no one knows who owns
the process, and the original author is no longer part of the
organization.
- Processes and scripts can't be discovered, and they are not
readily available when required (for example, in response to an
incident).

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- You understand who is responsible to perform an activity, who to
notify when action is needed, and who performs the action,
validates the result, and provides feedback to the owner of the
activity.
- Processes and procedures boost your efforts to operate your
workloads.
- New team members become effective more quickly.
- You reduce the time it takes to mitigate incidents.
- Different teams use the same processes and procedures to perform
tasks in a consistent manner.
- Teams can scale their processes with repeatable processes.
- Standardized processes and procedures help mitigate the impact
of transferring workload responsibilties between teams.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To begin to define responsibilities, start with existing
documentation, like responsibility matrices, processes and
procedures, roles and responsibilities, and tools and automation.
Review and host discussions on the responsibilities for documented
processes. Review with teams to identify misalignments between
document responsibilities and processes. Discuss services offered
with internal customers of that team to identify expectations gaps
between teams.

Analyze and address the discrepancies. Identify opportunities to
improvement, and look for frequently requested, resource-intensive
activities, which are typically strong candidates for improvement.
Explore best practices, patterns, and prescriptive guidance to
simplify and standardize improvements. Record improvement
opportunities, and track the improvements to completion.

Over time, these procedures should be evolved to be run as code,
reducing the need for human intervention. For example, procedures
can be initiated as AWS Lambda functions, CloudFormation
templates, or AWS Systems Manager Automation documents. Verify
that these procedures are version-controlled in appropriate
repositories, and include suitable resource tagging so that teams
can readily identify owners and documentation. Document the
responsibility for carrying out the activities, and then monitor
the automations for successful initiation and operation, as well
as performance of the desired outcomes.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail defines ownership as the team or individual that
owns processes for an application or groups of applications that
share common architectural practices and technologies. Initially,
the company documents the processes and procedures as step-by-step
guides in the document management system. They make the procedures
discoverable using tags on the AWS account that hosts the
application and on specific groups of resources within the
account, using AWS Organizations to manage their AWS accounts.
Over time, AnyCompany Retail converts these processes to code and
defines resources using infrastructure as code (through services
like CloudFormation or AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) templates). The
operational processes become Automation documents in AWS Systems Manager or AWS Lambda functions, which can be initiated as
scheduled tasks in response to events such as Amazon CloudWatch
alarms or Amazon EventBridge events or by requests within an IT
service management (ITSM) platform. All processes have tags to
identify who owns them. Teams manage documentation for the
automation and process within the wiki pages generated by the code
repository for the process.

### Implementation steps

- Document the existing processes and procedures.

Review and verify that they are up-to-date.
- Verify that each process or procedure has an owner.
- Place the procedures under version control.
- Where possible, share processes and procedures across
workloads and environments that share architectural
designs.

- Establish mechanisms for feedback and improvement.

Define policies for how frequently processes should be
reviewed.
- Define processes for reviewers and approvers.
- Implement issues or a ticketing queue to provide and
track feedback.
- Wherever possible, provide pre-approval and risk
classification for processes and procedures from a
change approval board (CAB).

- Make process and procedures accessible and discoverable by
users who need to run them.

Use tags to indicate where the process and procedures
can be accessed for the workload.
- Use meaningful error and event messaging to indicate the
appropriate process or proceedure to address the issue.
- Use wikis or document management to make processes and
procedures consistently searchable across the
organization.

- Automate when it is appropriate to do so.

Where services and technologies provide an API, develop
automations.
- Verify that processes are well-understood, and develop
the user stories and requirements to automate those
processes.
- Measure the successful use of processes and procedures,
with issue tracking to support iterative improvement.

# OPS02-BP04 Mechanisms exist to manage responsibilities and ownership

Understand the responsibilities of your role and how you contribute
to business outcomes, as this understanding informs the
prioritization of your tasks and why your role is important. This
helps team members recognize needs and respond appropriately. When
team members know their role, they can establish ownership, identify
improvement opportunities, and understand how to influence or make
appropriate changes.

Occasionally, a responsibility might not have a clear owner. In
these situations, design a mechanism to resolve this gap. Create a
well-defined escalation path to someone with the authority to assign
ownership or plan to address the need.

**Desired outcome:** Teams within
your organization have clearly-defined responsibilities that include
how they are related to resources, actions to be performed,
processes, and procedures. These responsibilities align to the
team's responsibilities and goals, as well as the responsibilities
of other teams. You document the routes of escalation in a
consistent and discoverable manner and feed these decisions into
documentation artifacts, such as responsibility matrices, team
definitions, or wiki pages.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- The responsibilities of the team are ambiguous or
poorly-defined.
- The team does not align roles with responsibilities.
- The team does not align its goals and objectives its
responsibilities, which makes it difficult to measure success.
- Team member responsibilities do not align with the team and the
wider organization.
- Your team does not keep responsibilities up-to-date, which makes
them inconsistent with the tasks performed by the team.
- Escalation paths for determining responsibilities aren't defined
or are unclear.
- Escalation paths have no single thread owner to ensure timely
reponse.
- Roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths are not
discoverable, and they are not readily available when required
(for example, in response to an incident).

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- When you understand who has responsibility or ownership, you can
contact the proper team or team member to make a request or
transition a task.
- To reduce the risk of inaction and unaddressed needs, you have
identified a person who has the authority to assign
responsibility or ownership.
- When you clearly define the scope of a responsibility, your team
members gain autonomy and ownership.
- Your responsibilities inform the decisions you make, the actions
you take, and your handoff activities to their proper owners.
- It's easy to identify abandoned responsibilities because you
have a clear understanding of what falls outside of your team's
responsibility, which helps you escalate for clarification.
- Teams avoid confusion and tension, and they can more adequately
manage their workloads and resources.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Identify team members roles and responsibilities, and verify that
they understand the expectations of their role. Make this
information discoverable so that members of your organization can
identify who they need to contact for specific needs, whether it's
a team or individual. As organizations seek to capitalize on the
opportunities to migrate and modernize on AWS, roles and
responsibilities might also change. Keep your teams and their
members aware of their responsibilities, and train them
appropriately to carry out their tasks during this change.

Determine the role or team that should receive escalations to
identify responsibility and ownership. This team can engage with
various stakeholders to come to a decision. However, they should
own the management of the decision making process.

Provide accessible mechanisms for members of your organization to
discover and identify ownership and responsibility. These
mechanisms teach them who to contact for specific needs.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail recently completed a migration of workloads from
an on-premises environment to their landing zone in AWS with a
lift and shift approach. They performed an operations review to
reflect on how they accomplish common operational tasks and
verified that their existing responsibility matrix reflects
operations in the new environment. When they migrated from
on-premises to AWS, they reduced the infrastructure teams
responsibilities relating to the hardware and physical
infrastructure. This move also revealed new opportunities to
evolve the operating model for their workloads.

While they identified, addressed, and documented the majority of
responsibilities, they also defined escalation routes for any
responsibilities that were missed or that may need to change as
operations practices evolve. To explore new opportunities to
standardize and improve efficiency across your workloads, provide
access to operations tools like AWS Systems Manager and security
tools like AWS Security Hub CSPM and Amazon GuardDuty. AnyCompany
Retail puts together a review of responsibilities and strategy
based on improvements they wants to address first. As the company
adopts new ways of working and technology patterns, they update
their responsibility matrix to match.

### Implementation steps

- Start with existing documentation. Some typical source
documents might include:

Responsibility or responsible, accountable, consulted,
and informed (RACI) matrices
- Team definitions or wiki pages
- Service definitions and offerings
- Role or job descriptions

- Review and host discussions on the documented
responsibilities:

Review with teams to identify misalignments between
documented responsibilities and responsibilities the
team typically performs.
- Discuss potential services offered by internal customers
to identify gaps in expectations between teams.

- Analysis and address the discrepancies.
- Identify opportunities for improvement.

Identify frequently-requested, resource-intensive
requests, which are typically strong candidates for
improvement.
- Look for best practices, understand patterns, follow prescriptive
guidance, and simplify and standardize improvements.
- Record improvement opportunities, and track them to
completion.

- If a team doesn't already hold responsibility for managing
and tracking the assignment of responsibilities, identify
someone on the team to hold this responsibility.
- Define a process for teams to request clarification of
responsibility.

Review the process, and verify that it is clear and
simple to use.
- Make sure that someone owns and tracks escalations to
their conclusion.
- Establish operational metrics to measure effectiveness.
- Create a feedback mechanisms to verify that teams can
highlight improvement opportunities.
- Implement a mechanism for periodic review.

- Document in a discoverable and accessible location.

Wikis or documentation portal are common choices.

# OPS02-BP05 Mechanisms exist to request additions, changes, and exceptions

You can make requests to owners of processes, procedures, and resources. Requests
include additions, changes, and exceptions. These requests go through a change management
process. Make informed decisions to approve requests where viable and determined to be
appropriate after an evaluation of benefits and risks.

**Desired outcome:**

- You can make requests to change processes, procedures, and resources based on assigned ownership.
- Changes are made in a deliberate manner, weighing benefits and risks.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You must update the way you deploy your application, but there is no way to request a change to the deployment process from the operations team.
- The disaster recovery plan must be updated, but there is no identified owner to request changes to.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Processes, procedures, and resources can evolve as requirements change.
- Owners can make informed decisions when to make changes.
- Changes are made in a deliberate manner.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To implement this best practice, you need to be able to request changes to processes,
procedures, and resources. The change management process can be lightweight. Document
the change management process.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail uses a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix to identify who owns changes for processes, procedures,
and resources. They have a documented change management process that’s lightweight and easy
to follow. Using the RACI matrix and the process, anyone can submit change requests.

**Implementation steps**

- Identify the processes, procedures, and resources for your workload and the owners for each. Document them in your knowledge management system.

If you have not implemented [OPS02-BP01 Resources have identified owners](./ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html),
[OPS02-BP02 Processes and procedures have identified owners](./ops_ops_model_def_proc_owners.html), or
[OPS02-BP03 Operations activities have identified owners responsible for their performance](./ops_ops_model_def_activity_owners.html), start with those first.

- Work with stakeholders in your organization to develop a change management process.
The process should cover additions, changes, and exceptions for resources, processes, and procedures.

You can use [AWS Systems Manager Change Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-manager.html) as a change management platform for workload resources.

- Document the change management process in your knowledge management system.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. Developing a change
management process requires alignment with multiple stakeholders across your organization.

# OPS02-BP06 Responsibilities between teams are predefined or negotiated

Have defined or negotiated agreements between teams describing how they work with
and support each other (for example, response times, service level objectives, or
service-level agreements). Inter-team communications channels are documented.
Understanding the impact of the teams’ work on business outcomes and the outcomes
of other teams and organizations informs the prioritization of their tasks and
helps them respond appropriately.

When responsibility and ownership are undefined or unknown, you are
at risk of both not addressing necessary activities in a timely
fashion and of redundant and potentially conflicting efforts
emerging to address those needs.

**Desired outcome:**

- Inter-team working or support agreements are agreed to and documented.
- Teams that support or work with each other have defined communication channels and response expectations.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- An issue occurs in production and two separate teams start troubleshooting independent of each other. Their siloed efforts extend the outage.
- The operations team needs assistance from the development team but there is no agreed to response time. The request is stuck in the backlog.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Teams know how to interact and support each other.
- Expectations for responsiveness are known.
- Communications channels are clearly defined.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means that there is no ambiguity about how teams work with each other.
Formal agreements codify how teams work together or support each other. Inter-team communication channels
are documented.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail’s SRE team has a service level agreement with their development team. Whenever
the development team makes a request in their ticketing system, they can expect a response within
fifteen minutes. If there is a site outage, the SRE team takes lead in the investigation with support
from the development team.

**Implementation steps**

- Working with stakeholders across your organization, develop agreements between teams based on processes and procedures.

If a process or procedure is shared between two teams, develop a runbook on how the teams will work together.
- If there are dependencies between teams, agree to a response SLA for requests.

- Document responsibilities in your knowledge management system.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. If there are no existing agreements
between teams, it can take effort to come to agreement with stakeholders across your organization.

## Question OPS03

# OPS 3 — How does your organizational culture support your business outcomes?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 7

---

# OPS03-BP01 Provide executive sponsorship

At the highest level, senior leadership acts as the executive
sponsor to clearly set expectations and direction for the
organization's outcomes, including evaluating its success. The
sponsor advocates and drives adoption of best practices and
evolution of the organization.

**Desired outcome:** Organizations
that endeavor to adopt, transform, and optimize their cloud
operations establish clear lines of leadership and accountability
for desired outcomes. The organization understands each capability
required by the organization to accomplish a new outcome and assigns
ownership to functional teams for development. Leadership actively
sets this direction, assigns ownership, takes accountability, and
defines the work. As a result, individuals across the organization
can mobilize, feel inspired, and actively work towards the desired
objectives.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- There is a mandate for workload owners to migrate workloads to
AWS without a clear sponsor and plan for cloud operations. This
results in teams not consciously collaborating to improve and
mature their operational capabilities. Lack of operational best
practice standards overwhelm teams (such as operator-toil,
on-calls, and technical debt), which constrains innovation.
- A new organization-wide goal has been set to adopt an emerging
technology without providing leadership sponsor and strategy.
Teams interpret goals differently, which causes confusion on
where to focus efforts, why they matter, and how to measure
impact. Consequently, the organization loses momentum in
adopting the technology.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When executive sponsorship clearly communicates
and shares vision, direction, and goals, team members know what is
expected of them. Individuals and teams begin to intensely focus
effort in the same direction to accomplish defined objectives when
leaders are actively engaged. As a result, the organization maximizes
the ability to succeed. When you evaluate success, you can better
identify barriers to success so that they can be addressed through
intervention by the executive sponsor.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- At every phase of the cloud journey (migration, adoption, or
optimization), success requires active involvement at the
highest level of leadership with a designated executive
sponsor. The executive sponsor aligns the team's mindset,
skillsets, and ways of working to the defined strategy.

**Explain the
why:** Bring clarity and
explain the reasoning behind the vision and strategy.
- **Set expectations:**
Define and publish goals for your organizations, including
how progress and success are measured.
- **Track achievement of
goals:** Measure the incremental achievement of
goals regularly (not just completion of tasks). Share the
results so that appropriate action can be taken if
outcomes are at risk.
- **Provide the resources necessary to
achieve your goals:** Bring people and teams
together to collaborate and build the right solutions that
bring about the defined outcomes. This reduces or
eliminates organizational friction.
- **Advocate for your
teams:** Remain engaged with your teams so that
you understand their performance and whether there are
external factors affecting them. Identify obstacles that
are impeding your teams progress. Act on behalf of your
teams to help address obstacles and remove unnecessary
burdens. When your teams are impacted by external factors,
reevaluate goals and adjust targets as appropriate.
- **Drive adoption of best
practices:** Acknowledge best practices that
provide quantifiable benefits, and recognize the creators
and adopters. Encourage further adoption to magnify the
benefits achieved.
- **Encourage evolution of your
teams:** Create a culture of continual
improvement, and proactively learn from progress made as
well as failures. Encourage both personal and
organizational growth and development. Use data and
anecdotes to evolve the vision and strategy.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail is in the process of business transformation
through rapid reinvention of customer experiences, enhancement
of productivity, and acceleration of growth through generative AI.

### Implementation steps

- Establish single-threaded leadership, and assign a primary
executive sponsor to lead and drive the transformation.
- Define clear business outcomes of your transformation, and
assign ownership and accountability. Empower the primary
executive with the authority to lead and make critical
decisions.
- Verify that your transformational strategy is very clear and
communicated widely by the executive sponsor to every level
of the organization.

Establish clearly defined business objectives for IT and
cloud initiatives.
- Document key business metrics to drive IT and cloud
transformation.
- Communicate the vision consistently to all teams and
individuals responsible for parts of the strategy.

- Develop communication planning matrices that specify what
message needs to be delivered to specified leaders,
managers, and individual contributors. Specify the person or
team that should deliver this message.

Fulfill communications plans consistently and reliably.
- Set and manage expectations through in-person events on
a regular basis.
- Accept feedback on the effectiveness of communications,
and adjust the communications and plan accordingly.
- Schedule communication events to proactively understand
challenges from teams, and establish a consistent
feedback loop that allows for correcting course where
necessary.

- Actively engage each initiative from a leadership
perspective to verify that all impacted teams understand the
outcomes they are accountable to achieve.
- At every status meeting, executive sponsors should look for
blockers, inspect established metrics, anecdotes, or
feedback from the teams, and measure progress towards
objectives.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan** Medium

# OPS03-BP02 Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risk

A cultural behavior of ownership instilled by leadership results in
any employee feeling empowered to act on behalf of the entire
company beyond their defined scope of role and accountability.
Employees can act to proactively identify risks as they emerge and
take appropriate action. Such a culture allows employees to make
high value decisions with situational awareness.

For example, Amazon uses
[Leadership
Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) as the guidelines to drive desired behavior for
employees to move forward in situations, solve problems, deal with
conflict, and take action.

**Desired outcome:** Leadership has
influenced a new culture that allows individuals and teams to make
critical decisions, even at lower levels of the organization (as
long as decisions are defined with auditable permissions and safety
mechanisms). Failure is not discouraged, and teams iteratively learn
to improve their decision-making and responses to tackle similar
situations going forward. If someone's actions result in an
improvement that can benefit other teams, they proactively share
knowledge from such actions. Leadership measures operational
improvements and incentivizes the individual and organization for
adoption of such patterns.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- There isn't clear guidance or mechanisms in an organization for
what to do when a risk is identified. For example, when an
employee notices a phishing attack, they fail to report to the
security team, resulting in a large portion of the organization
falling for the attack. This causes a data breach.
- Your customers complain about service unavailability, which
primarily stems from failed deployments. Your SRE team is
responsible for the deployment tool, and an automated rollback
for deployments is in their long-term roadmap. In a recent
application rollout, one of the engineers devised a solution to
automate rolling back their application to a previous version.
Though their solution can become the pattern for SRE teams,
other teams do not adopt, as there is no process to track such
improvements. The organization continues to be plagued with
failed deployments impacting customers and causing further
negative sentiment.
- In order to stay compliant, your infosec team oversees a
long-established process to rotate shared SSH keys regularly on
behalf of operators connecting to their Amazon EC2 Linux
instances. It takes several days for the infosec teams to
complete rotating keys, and you are blocked from connecting to
those instances. No one inside or outside of infosec suggests
using other options on AWS to achieve the same result.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** By decentralizing authority to make decisions and
empowering your teams to decide key decisions, you are able to
address issues more quickly with increasing success rates. In
addition, teams start to realize a sense of ownership, and failures
are acceptable. Experimentation becomes a cultural mainstay.
Managers and directors do not feel as though they are micro-managed
through every aspect of their work.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- Develop a culture where it is expected that failures can
occur.
- Define clear ownership and accountability for various
functional areas within the organization.
- Communicate ownership and accountability to everyone so that
individuals know who can help them facilitate decentralized
decisions.
- Define your one-way and two-way door decisions to help
individuals know when they do need to escalate to higher
levels of leadership.
- Create organizational awareness that all employees are
empowered to take action at various levels when outcomes are
at risk. Provide your team members documentation of
governance, permission-levels, tools, and opportunities to
practice the skills necessary to respond effectively.
- Give your team members the opportunity to practice the skills
necessary to respond to various decisions. Once decision
levels are defined, perform game days to verify that all
individual contributors understand and can demonstrate the
process.

Provide alternative safe environments where processes and
procedures can be tested and trained upon.
- Acknowledge and create awareness that team members have
authority to take action when the outcome has a predefined
level of risk.
- Define the authority of your team members to take action
by assigning permissions and access to the workloads and
components they support.

- Provide ability for teams to share their learnings
(operational successes and failures).
- Empower teams to challenge the status quo, and provide
mechanisms to track and measure improvements, as well as their
impact to the organization.

plan:** Medium

# OPS03-BP03 Escalation is encouraged

Team members are encouraged by leadership to escalate issues and
concerns to higher-level decision makers and stakeholders if they
believe desired outcomes are at risk and expected standards are not
met. This is a feature of the organization's culture and is driven
at all levels. Escalation should be done early and often so that
risks can be identified and prevented from causing incidents.
Leadership does not reprimand individuals for escalating an issue.

**Desired outcome:** Individuals
throughout the organization are comfortable to escalate problems to
their immediate and higher levels of leadership. Leadership has
deliberately and consciously established expectations that their
teams should feel safe to escalate any issue. A mechanism exists to
escalate issues at each level within the organization. When
employees escalate to their manager, they jointly decide the level
of impact and whether the issue should be escalated. In order to
initiate an escalation, employees are required to include a
recommended work plan to address the issue. If direct management
does not take timely action, employees are encouraged to take issues
to the highest level of leadership if they feel strongly that the
risks to the organization warrant the escalation.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Executive leaders do not ask enough probing questions during
your cloud transformation program status meeting to find where
issues and blockers are occurring. Only good news is presented
as status. The CIO has made it clear that she only likes to hear
good news, as any challenges brought up make the CEO think that
the program is failing.
- You are a cloud operations engineer and you notice that the new
knowledge management system is not being widely adopted by
application teams. The company invested one year and several
million dollars to implement this new knowledge management
system, but people are still authoring their runbooks locally
and sharing them on an organizational cloud share, making it
difficult to find knowledge pertinent to supported workloads.
You try to bring this to leadership's attention, because
consistent use of this system can enhance operational
efficiency. When you bring this to the director who lead the
implementation of the knowledge management system, she
reprimands you because it calls the investment into question.
- The infosec team responsible for hardening compute resources has
decided to put a process in place that requires performing the
scans necessary to ensure that EC2 instances are fully secured
before the compute team releases the resource for use. This has
created a time delay of an additional week for resources to be
deployed, which breaks their SLA. The compute team is afraid to
escalate this to the VP over cloud because this makes the VP of
information security look bad.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

Complex or critical issues are addressed before they impact the
business. Less time is wasted. Risks are minimized. Teams become
more proactive and results focused when solving problems.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

The willingness and ability to escalate freely at every level in
the organization is an organizational and cultural foundation that
should be consciously developed through emphasized training,
leadership communications, expectation setting, and the deployment
of mechanisms throughout the organization at every level.

### Implementation steps

- Define policies, standards, and expectations for your
organization.

Ensure wide adoption and understanding of policies,
expectations, and standards.

- Encourage, train, and empower workers for early and frequent
escalation when standards are not met.
- Organizationally acknowledge that early and frequent
escalation is the best practice. Accept that escalations may
prove to be unfounded, and that it is better to have the
opportunity to prevent an incident then to miss that
opportunity by not escalating.

Build a mechanism for escalation (like an
Andon
cord system).
- Have documented procedures defining when and how
escalation should occur.
- Define the series of people with increasing authority to
take or approve action, as well as each stakeholder's
contact information.

- When escalation occurs, it should continue until the team
member is satisfied that the risk has been mitigated through
actions driven from leadership.

Escalations should include:

Description of the situation, and the nature of the
risk
- Criticality of the situation
- Who or what is impacted
- How great the impact is
- Urgency if impact occurs
- Suggested remedies and plans to mitigate

- Protect employees who escalate. Have policy that
protects team members from retribution if they escalate
around a non-responsive decision maker or stakeholder.
Have mechanisms in place to identify if this is
occurring and respond appropriately.

- Encourage a culture of continuous improvement feedback loops
in everything that the organization produces. Feedback loops
act as minor escalations to individuals responsible, and
they identify improvement opportunities, even when
escalation is not needed. Continuous improvement cultures
force everyone to be more proactive.
- Leadership should periodically reemphasize the policies,
standards, mechanisms, and the desire for open escalation
and continuous feedback loops without retribution.

**Level of effort for the Implementation
Plan:** Medium

# OPS03-BP04 Communications are timely, clear, and actionable

Leadership is responsible for the creation of strong and effective
communications, especially when the organization adopts new
strategies, technologies, or ways of working. Leaders should set
expectations for all staff to work towards the company objectives.
Devise communication mechanisms that create and maintain awareness
among the teams responsible for running plans that are funded and
sponsored by leadership. Make use of cross-organizational diversity,
and listen attentively to multiple unique perspectives. Use this
perspective to increase innovation, challenge your assumptions, and
reduce the risk of confirmation bias. Foster inclusion, diversity,
and accessibility within your teams to gain beneficial perspectives.

**Desired outcome:** Your
organization designs communication strategies to address the impact
of change to the organization. Teams remain informed and motivated
to continue working with one another rather than against each other.
Individuals understand how important their role is to achieve the
stated objectives. Email is only a passive mechanism for
communications and used accordingly. Management spends time with
their individual contributors to help them understand their
responsibility, the tasks to complete, and how their work
contributes to the overall mission. When necessary, leaders engage
people directly in smaller venues to convey messages and verify that
these messages are being delivered effectively. As a result of good
communications strategies, the organization performs at or above the
expectations of leadership. Leadership encourages and seeks diverse
opinions within and across teams.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your organization has a five year plan to migrate all workloads
to AWS. The business case for cloud includes the modernization
of 25% of all workloads to take advantage of serverless
technology. The CIO communicates this strategy to direct reports
and expects each leader to cascade this presentation to
managers, directors, and individual contributors without any
in-person communication. The CIO steps back and expects his
organization to perform the new strategy.
- Leadership does not provide or use a mechanism for feedback, and
an expectation gap grows, which leads to stalled projects.
- You are asked to make a change to your security groups, but you
are not given any details of what change needs to be made, what
the impact of the change could be on all the workloads, and when
it should happen. The manager forwards an email from the VP of
InfoSec and adds the message "Make this happen."
- Changes were made to your migration strategy that reduce the
planned modernization number from 25% to 10%. This has
downstream effects on the operations organization. They were not
informed of this strategic change and thus, they are not ready
with enough skilled capacity to support a greater number of
workloads lifted and shifted into AWS.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Your organization is well-informed on new or changed strategies,
and they act accordingly with strong motivation to help each
other achieve the overall objectives and metrics set by
leadership.
- Mechanisms exist and are used to provide timely notice to team
members of known risks and planned events.
- New ways of working (including changes to people or the
organization, processes, or technology), along with required
skills, are more effectively adopted by the organization, and
your organization realizes business benefits more quickly.
- Team members have the necessary context of the communications
being received, and they can be more effective in their jobs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To implement this best practice, you must work with stakeholders
across your organization to agree to communication standards.
Publicize those standards to your organization. For any
significant IT transitions, an established planning team can more
successfully manage the impact of change to its people than an
organization that ignores this practice. Larger organizations can
be more challenging when managing change because it's critical to
establish strong buy-in on a new strategy with all individual
contributors. In the absence of such a transition planning team,
leadership holds 100% of the responsibility for effective
communications. When establishing a transition planning team,
assign team members to work with all organizational leadership to
define and manage effective communications at every level.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail signed up for AWS Enterprise Support and depends
on other third-party providers for its cloud operations. The
company uses chat and chatops as their main communication medium
for operational activities. Alerts and other information populate
specific channels. When someone must act, they clearly state the
desired outcome, and in many cases, they receive a runbook or
playbook to use. They schedule major changes to production systems
with a change calendar.

### Implementation steps

- Establish a core team within the organization that has
accountability to build and initiate communication plans for
changes that happen at multiple levels within the
organization.
- Institute single-threaded ownership to achieve oversight.
Give individual teams the ability to innovate independently,
and balance the use of consistent mechanisms, which allows
for the right level of inspection and directional vision.
- Work with stakeholders across your organization to agree to
communication standards, practices, and plans.
- Verify that the core communications team collaborates with
organizational and program leadership to craft messages to
appropriate staff on behalf of leaders.
- Build strategic communication mechanisms to manage change
through announcements, shared calendars, all-hands meetings,
and in-person or one-on-one methods so that team members
have proper expectations on the actions they should take.
- Provide necessary context, details, and time (when possible)
to determine if action is necessary. When action is needed,
provide the required action and its impact.
- Implement tools that facilitate tactical communications,
like internal chat, email, and knowledge management.
- Implement mechanisms to measure and verify that all
communications lead to desired outcomes.
- Establish a feedback loop that measures the effectiveness of
all communications, especially when communications are related
to resistance to changes throughout the organization.
- For all AWS accounts, establish
[alternate
contacts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-update-contact-alternate.html) for billing, security, and operations.
Ideally, each contact should be an email distribution as
opposed to a specific individual contact.
- Establish an escalation and reverse escalation communication
plan to engage with your internal and external teams,
including AWS support and other third-party providers.
- Initiate and perform communication strategies consistently
throughout the life of each transformation program.
- Prioritize actions that are repeatable where possible to
safely automate at scale.
- When communications are required in scenarios with automated
actions, the communication's purpose should be to inform
teams, for auditing, or a part of the change management
process.
- Analyze communications from your alert systems for false
positives or alerts that are constantly created. Remove or
change these alerts so that they start when human
intervention is required. If an alert is initiated, provide
a runbook or playbook.

You can use
[AWS Systems Manager Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-ssm-docs.html) to build playbooks and
runbooks for alerts.

- Mechanisms are in place to provide notification of risks or
planned events in a clear and actionable way with enough
notice to allow appropriate responses. Use email lists or
chat channels to send notifications ahead of planned events.

[AWS Chatbot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/what-is.html) can be used to send alerts and respond to
events within your organizations messaging platform.

- Provide an accessible source of information where planned
events can be discovered. Provide notifications of planned
events from the same system.

[AWS Systems Manager Change Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html) can be used to
create change windows when changes can occur. This
provides team members notice when they can make changes
safely.

- Monitor vulnerability notifications and patch information to
understand vulnerabilities in the wild and potential risks
associated to your workload components. Provide notification
to team members so that they can act.

You can subscribe to
[AWS Security Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/) to receive notifications of
vulnerabilities on AWS.

- **Seek diverse opinions and
perspectives:** Encourage contributions from
everyone. Give communication opportunities to
under-represented groups. Rotate roles and responsibilities
in meetings.

**Expand roles and
responsibilities:** Provide opportunities for
team members to take on roles that they might not
otherwise. They can gain experience and perspective from
the role and from interactions with new team members
with whom they might not otherwise interact. They can
also bring their experience and perspective to the new
role and team members they interact with. As perspective
increases, identify emergent business opportunities or
new opportunities for improvement. Rotate common tasks
between members within a team that others typically
perform to understand the demands and impact of
performing them.
- **Provide a safe and welcoming
environment:** Establish policy and controls
that protect the mental and physical safety of team
members within your organization. Team members should be
able to interact without fear of reprisal. When team
members feel safe and welcome, they are more likely to
be engaged and productive. The more diverse your
organization, the better your understanding can be of
the people you support, including your customers. When
your team members are comfortable, feel free to speak,
and are confident they are heard, they are more likely
to share valuable insights (for example, marketing
opportunities, accessibility needs, unserved market
segments, and unacknowledged risks in your environment).
- **Encourage team members to
participate fully:** Provide the resources
necessary for your employees to participate fully in all
work related activities. Team members that face daily
challenges develop skills for working around them. These
uniquely-developed skills can provide significant
benefit to your organization. Support team members with
necessary accommodations to increase the benefits you
can receive from their contributions.

# OPS03-BP05 Experimentation is encouraged

Experimentation is a catalyst for turning new ideas into products and features. It accelerates learning and keeps team members interested and engaged. Team members are encouraged to experiment often to drive innovation. Even when an undesired result occurs, there is value in knowing what not to do. Team members are not punished for successful experiments with undesired results.

**Desired outcome:**

- Your organization encourages experimentation to foster innovation.
- Experiments are used as an opportunity to learn.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You want to run an A/B test but there is no mechanism to run the experiment. You deploy a UI change without the ability to test it. It results in a negative customer experience.
- Your company only has a stage and production environment. There is no sandbox environment to experiment with new features or products so you must experiment within the production environment.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Experimentation drives innovation.
- You can react faster to feedback from users through experimentation.
- Your organization develops a culture of learning.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Experiments should be run in a safe manner. Leverage multiple environments to experiment without jeopardizing production resources. Use A/B testing and feature flags to test experiments. Provide team members the ability to conduct experiments in a sandbox environment.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail encourages experimentation. Team members can use 20% of their work week to experiment or learn new technologies. They have a sandbox environment where they can innovate. A/B testing is used for new features to validate them with real user feedback.

**Implementation steps**

- Work with leadership across your organization to support experimentation. Team members should be encouraged to conduct experiments in a safe manner.
- Provide your team members with an environment where they can safely experiment. They must have access to an environment that is like production.

You can use a separate AWS account to create a sandbox environment for experimentation. [AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html) can be used to provision these accounts.

- Use feature flags and A/B testing to experiment safely and gather user feedback.

[AWS AppConfig Feature Flags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) provides the ability to create feature flags.
- You can use [AWS Lambda versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html) to deploy a new version of a function for beta testing.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** High. Providing team members with an environment to experiment in and a safe way to conduct experiments can require significant investment. You may also need to modify application code to use feature flags or support A/B testing.

# OPS03-BP06 Team members are encouraged to maintain and grow their skill sets

Teams must grow their skill sets to adopt new technologies, and to
support changes in demand and responsibilities in support of your
workloads. Growth of skills in new technologies is frequently a
source of team member satisfaction and supports innovation. Support
your team members' pursuit and maintenance of industry
certifications that validate and acknowledge their growing skills.
Cross train to promote knowledge transfer and reduce the risk of
significant impact when you lose skilled and experienced team
members with institutional knowledge. Provide dedicated structured
time for learning.

AWS provides resources, including the
[AWS Getting Started Resource Center](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/),
[AWS Blogs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/),
[AWS Online
Tech Talks](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/),
[AWS Events and
Webinars](https://aws.amazon.com/events/), and the
[AWS Well-Architected Labs](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/), that provide guidance, examples, and
detailed walkthroughs to educate your teams.

Resources such as
[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/), ([AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/),
[Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/)), and
[AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/welcome.html) help remove technical roadblocks and improve
operations. Reach out to Support through Support Center for
help with your questions.

AWS also shares best practices and patterns that we have learned
through the operation of AWS in
[The
Amazon Builders' Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/) and a wide variety of other useful
educational material through the
[AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/) and
[The
Official AWS Podcast](https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/).

[AWS Training and
Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) includes free training through self-paced
digital courses, along with learning plans by role or domain. You
can also register for instructor-led training to further support the
development of your teams' AWS skills.

**Desired outcome:** Your
organization constantly evaluates skill gaps and closes them with
structured budget and investment. Teams encourage and incentivize
their members with upskilling activities such as acquiring leading
industry certifications. Teams take advantage of dedicated
cross-sharing knowledge programs such as lunch-and-learns, immersion
days, hackathons, and gamedays. Your organization's keeps its
knowledge systems up-to-date and relevant to cross-train team
members, including new-hire onboarding trainings.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- In the absence of a structured training program and budget,
teams experience uncertainty as they try to keep pace with
technology evolution, which results in increased attrition.
- As part of migrating to AWS, your organization demonstrates
skill gaps and varying cloud fluency amongst teams. Without an
effort to upskill, teams find themselves overtasked with legacy
and inefficient management of the cloud environment, which
causes increased operator toil. This burn out increases employee
dissatisfaction.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When your organization consciously invests in
improving the skills of its teams, it also helps accelerate and
scale cloud adoption and optimization. Targeted learning programs
drive innovation and build operational ability for teams to be
prepared to handle events. Teams consciously invest in the
implementation and evolution of best practices. Team morale is high,
and team members value their contribution to the business.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To adopt new technologies, fuel innovation, and keep pace with
changes in demand and responsibilities to support your workloads,
continually invest in the professional growth of your teams.

### Implementation steps

- **Use structured cloud advocacy
programs:**
[AWS Skills Guild](https://aws.amazon.com/training/teams/aws-skills-guild/) provides consultative training to increase
cloud skill confidence and ignite a culture of continuous
learning.
- **Provide resources for
education:** Provide dedicated, structured time and
access to training materials and lab resources, and support
participation in conferences and access to professional organizations
that provide opportunities for learning from both educators
and peers. Provide your junior team members with access to
senior team members as mentors, or allow the junior team
members to shadow their seniors' work and be exposed to their
methods and skills. Encourage learning about content not
directly related to work in order to have a broader
perspective.
- **Encourage use of expert technical
resources:** Leverage resources such as
[AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/) to
get access to curated knowledge and vibrant community.
- **Build and maintain an up-to-date
knowledge repository:** Use knowledge sharing
platforms such as wikis and runbooks. Create your own reusable
expert knowledge source with
[AWS re:Post Private](https://aws.amazon.com/repost-private/) to streamline collaboration, improve
productivity, and accelerate employee onboarding.
- **Team education and cross-team
engagement:** Plan for the continuing education needs
of your team members. Provide opportunities for team members
to join other teams (temporarily or permanently) to share
skills and best practices benefiting your entire organization.
- **Support pursuit and maintenance of
industry certifications:** Support your team members
in the acquisition and maintenance of industry certifications
that validate what they have learned and acknowledge their
accomplishments.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** High

# OPS03-BP07 Resource teams appropriately

Provision the right amount of proficient team members, and provide
tools and resources to support your workload needs. Overburdening
team members increases the risk of human error. Investments in tools
and resources, such as automation, can scale the effectiveness of
your team and help them support a greater number of workloads
without requiring additional capacity.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have appropriately staffed your team to gain the skillsets
needed for them to operate workloads in AWS in accordance with
your migration plan. As your team has scaled itself up during
the course of your migration project, they have gained
proficiency in the core AWS technologies that the business plans
to use when migrating or modernizing their applications.
- You have carefully aligned your staffing plan to make efficient
use of resources by leveraging automation and workflow. A
smaller team can now manage more infrastructure on behalf of the
application development teams.
- With shifting operational priorities, any resource staffing
constraints are proactively identified to protect the success of
business initiatives.
- Operational metrics that report operational toil (such as
on-call fatigue or excessive paging) are reviewed to verify that
staff are not overwhelmed.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your staff have not ramped up on AWS skills as you close in on
your multi-year cloud migration plan, which risks support of the
workloads and lowers employee morale.
- Your entire IT organization is shifting into agile ways of
working. The business is prioritizing the product portfolio and
setting metrics for what features need to be developed first.
Your agile process does not require teams to assign story points
to their work plans. As a result, it is impossible to know the
level of capacity required for the next amount of work, or if
you have the right skills assigned to the work.
- You are having an AWS partner migrate your workloads, and you
don't have a support transition plan for your teams once the
partner completes the migration project. Your teams struggle to
efficiently and effectively support the workloads.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** You have appropriately-skilled team members
available in your organization to support the workloads. Resource
allocation can adapt to shifting priorities without impacting
performance. The result is teams being proficient at supporting
workloads while maximizing time to focus on innovating for
customers, which in turn raises employee satisfaction.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Resource planning for your cloud migration should occur at an
organizational level that aligns to your migration plan, as well
as the desired operating model being implemented to support your
new cloud environment. This should include understanding which
cloud technologies are deployed for the business and application
development teams. Infrastructure and operations leadership should
plan for skills gap analysis, training, and role definition for
engineers who are leading cloud adoption.

### Implementation steps

- Define success criteria for team's success with relevant
operational metrics such as staff productivity (for example,
cost to support a workload or operator hours spent during
incidents).
- Define resource capacity planning and inspection mechanisms
to verify that the right balance of qualified capacity is
available when needed and can be adjusted over time.
- Create mechanisms (for example, sending a monthly survey to
teams) to understand work-related challenges that impact
teams (like increasing responsibilities, changes in
technology, loss of personnel, or increase in customers
supported).
- Use these mechanisms to engage with teams and spot trends
that may contribute to employee productivity challenges.
When your teams are impacted by external factors, reevaluate
goals and adjust targets as appropriate. Identify obstacles
that are impeding your team's progress.
- Regularly review if your currently-provisioned resources are
still sufficient, of if additional resources are needed, and
make appropriate adjustments to support teams.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

## Question OPS04

# OPS 4 — How do you implement observability in your workload?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 5

---

# OPS04-BP01 Identify key performance indicators

Implementing observability in your workload starts with understanding its state and making data-driven decisions based on business requirements. One of the most effective ways to ensure alignment between monitoring activities and business objectives is by defining and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).

**Desired outcome:** Efficient observability practices that are tightly aligned with business objectives, ensuring that monitoring efforts are always in service of tangible business outcomes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Undefined KPIs: Working without clear KPIs can lead to monitoring too much or too little, missing vital signals.
- Static KPIs: Not revisiting or refining KPIs as the workload or business objectives evolve.
- Misalignment: Focusing on technical metrics that don’t correlate directly with business outcomes or are harder to correlate with real-world issues.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Ease of issue identification: Business KPIs often surface issues more clearly than technical metrics. A dip in a business KPI can pinpoint a problem more effectively than sifting through numerous technical metrics.
- Business alignment: Ensures that monitoring activities directly support business objectives.
- Efficiency: Prioritize monitoring resources and attention on metrics that matter.
- Proactivity: Recognize and address issues before they have broader business implications.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To effectively define workload KPIs:

- **Start with business outcomes:** Before diving into metrics, understand the desired business outcomes. Is it increased sales, higher user engagement, or faster response times?
- **Correlate technical metrics with business objectives:** Not all technical metrics have a direct impact on business outcomes. Identify those that do, but it's often more straightforward to identify an issue using a business KPI.
- **Use [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html):** Employ CloudWatch to define and monitor metrics that represent your KPIs.
- **Regularly review and update KPIs:** As your workload and business evolve, keep your KPIs relevant.
- **Involve stakeholders:** Involve both technical and business teams in defining and reviewing KPIs.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

# OPS04-BP02 Implement application telemetry

Application telemetry serves as the foundation for observability of
your workload. It's crucial to emit telemetry that offers actionable
insights into the state of your application and the achievement of
both technical and business outcomes. From troubleshooting to
measuring the impact of a new feature or ensuring alignment with
business key performance indicators (KPIs), application telemetry
informs the way you build, operate, and evolve your workload.

Metrics, logs, and traces form the three primary pillars of
observability. These serve as diagnostic tools that describe the
state of your application. Over time, they assist in creating
baselines and identifying anomalies. However, to ensure alignment
between monitoring activities and business objectives, it's pivotal
to define and monitor KPIs. Business KPIs often make it easier to
identify issues compared to technical metrics alone.

Other telemetry types, like real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic
transactions, complement these primary data sources. RUM offers
insights into real-time user interactions, whereas synthetic
transactions simulate potential user behaviors, helping detect
bottlenecks before real users encounter them.

**Desired outcome:** Derive
actionable insights into the performance of your workload. These
insights allow you to make proactive decisions about performance
optimization, achieve increased workload stability, streamline CI/CD
processes, and utilize resources effectively.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- **Incomplete observability:** Neglecting to incorporate
observability at every layer of the workload, resulting in blind
spots that can obscure vital system performance and behavior
insights.
- **Fragmented data view:** When data is scattered across multiple
tools and systems, it becomes challenging to maintain a holistic
view of your workload's health and performance.
- **User-reported issues:** A sign that proactive issue detection
through telemetry and business KPI monitoring is lacking.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- **Informed decision-making:** With insights from telemetry and
business KPIs, you can make data-driven decisions.
- **Improved operational efficiency:** Data-driven resource
utilization leads to cost-effectiveness.
- **Enhanced workload stability:** Faster detection and resolution of
issues leading to improved uptime.
- **Streamlined CI/CD processes:** Insights from telemetry data
facilitate refinement of processes and reliable code delivery.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To implement application telemetry for your workload, use AWS
services like
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and
[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/).
Amazon CloudWatch provides a comprehensive suite of monitoring
tools, allowing you to observe your resources and applications in
AWS and on-premises environments. It collects, tracks, and
analyzes metrics, consolidates and monitors log data, and responds
to changes in your resources, enhancing your understanding of how
your workload operates. In tandem, AWS X-Ray lets you trace,
analyze, and debug your applications, giving you a deep
understanding of your workload's behavior. With features like
service maps, latency distributions, and trace timelines, AWS X-Ray provides insights into your workload's performance and the
bottlenecks affecting it.

### Implementation steps

- **Identify what data to
collect:** Ascertain the essential metrics, logs,
and traces that would offer substantial insights into your
workload's health, performance, and behavior.
- **Deploy the
[CloudWatch
agent](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/):** The CloudWatch agent is
instrumental in procuring system and application metrics and
logs from your workload and its underlying infrastructure.
The CloudWatch agent can also be used to collect
OpenTelemetry or X-Ray traces and send them to X-Ray.
- **Implement anomaly detection for logs
and metrics:** Use
[CloudWatch Logs anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/LogsAnomalyDetection.html) and
[CloudWatch

# OPS04-BP03 Implement user experience telemetry

Gaining deep insights into customer experiences and interactions with your application is crucial. Real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic transactions serve as powerful tools for this purpose. RUM provides data about real user interactions granting an unfiltered perspective of user satisfaction, while synthetic transactions simulate user interactions, helping in detecting potential issues even before they impact real users.

**Desired outcome:** A holistic view of the customer experience, proactive detection of issues, and optimization of user interactions to deliver seamless digital experiences.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Applications without real user monitoring (RUM):

Delayed issue detection: Without RUM, you might not become aware of performance bottlenecks or issues until users complain. This reactive approach can lead to customer dissatisfaction.
- Lack of user experience insights: Not using RUM means you lose out on crucial data that shows how real users interact with your application, limiting your ability to optimize the user experience.

- Applications without synthetic transactions:

Missed edge cases: Synthetic transactions help you test paths and functions that might not be frequently used by typical users but are critical to certain business functions. Without them, these paths could malfunction and go unnoticed.
- Checking for issues when the application is not being used: Regular synthetic testing can simulate times when real users aren't actively interacting with your application, ensuring the system always functions correctly.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Proactive issue detection: Identify and address potential issues before they impact real users.
- Optimized user experience: Continuous feedback from RUM aids in refining and enhancing the overall user experience.
- Insights on device and browser performance: Understand how your application performs across various devices and browsers, enabling further optimization.
- Validated business workflows: Regular synthetic transactions ensure that core functionalities and critical paths remain operational and efficient.
- Enhanced application performance: Leverage insights gathered from real user data to improve application responsiveness and reliability.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To leverage RUM and synthetic transactions for user activity telemetry, AWS offers services like [Amazon CloudWatch RUM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) and [Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html). Metrics, logs, and traces, coupled with user activity data, provide a comprehensive view of both the application's operational state and the user experience.

### Implementation steps

- **Deploy Amazon CloudWatch RUM:** Integrate your application with CloudWatch RUM to collect, analyze, and present real user data.

Use the [CloudWatch RUM JavaScript library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) to integrate RUM with your application.
- Set up dashboards to visualize and monitor real user data.

- **Configure CloudWatch Synthetics:** Create canaries, or scripted routines, that simulate user interactions with your application.

Define critical application workflows and paths.
- Design canaries using [CloudWatch Synthetics scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) to simulate user interactions for these paths.
- Schedule and monitor canaries to run at specified intervals, ensuring consistent performance checks.

- **Analyze and act on data:** Utilize data from RUM and synthetic transactions to gain insights and take corrective measures when anomalies are detected. Use CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to stay informed.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

# OPS04-BP04 Implement dependency telemetry

Dependency telemetry is essential for monitoring the health and
performance of the external services and components your workload
relies on. It provides valuable insights into reachability,
timeouts, and other critical events related to dependencies such as
DNS, databases, or third-party APIs. When you instrument your
application to emit metrics, logs, and traces about these
dependencies, you gain a clearer understanding of potential
bottlenecks, performance issues, or failures that might impact your
workload.

**Desired outcome:** Ensure that the
dependencies your workload relies on are performing as expected,
allowing you to proactively address issues and ensure optimal
workload performance.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- **Overlooking external dependencies:** Focusing only on internal
application metrics while neglecting metrics related to external
dependencies.
- **Lack of proactive monitoring:** Waiting for issues to arise
instead of continuously monitoring dependency health and
performance.
- **Siloed monitoring:** Using multiple, disparate monitoring tools
which can result in fragmented and inconsistent views of
dependency health.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- **Improved workload reliability:** By ensuring that external
dependencies are consistently available and performing
optimally.
- **Faster issue detection and resolution:** Proactively identifying
and addressing issues with dependencies before they impact the
workload.
- **Comprehensive view:** Gaining a holistic view of both internal and
external components that influence workload health.
- **Enhanced workload scalability:** By understanding the scalability
limits and performance characteristics of external dependencies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement dependency telemetry by starting with identifying the
services, infrastructure, and processes that your workload depends
on. Quantify what good conditions look like when those
dependencies are functioning as expected, and then determine what
data will be needed to measure those. With that information you
can craft dashboards and alerts that provide insights to your
operations teams on the state of those dependencies. Use AWS tools
to discover and quantify the impacts when dependencies cannot
deliver as needed. Continually revisit your strategy to account
for changes in priorities, goals, and gained insights.

### Implementation steps

To implement dependency telemetry effectively:

- **Identify external
dependencies:** Collaborate with stakeholders to
pinpoint the external dependencies your workload relies on.
External dependencies can encompass services like external
databases, third-party APIs, network connectivity routes to
other environments, and DNS services. The first step towards
effective dependency telemetry is being comprehensive in
understanding what those dependencies are.
- **Develop a monitoring
strategy:** Once you have a clear picture of your
external dependencies, architect a monitoring strategy
tailored to them. This involves understanding the
criticality of each dependency, its expected behavior, and
any associated service-level agreements or targets (SLA or
SLTs). Set up proactive alerts to notify you of status
changes or performance deviations.
- **Use
[network
monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Network-Monitoring-Sections.html):** Use
[Internet
Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html) and
[Network
Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/what-is-network-monitor.html), which provide comprehensive insights into
global internet and network conditions. These tools help you
understand and respond to outages, disruptions, or
performance degradations that affect your external
dependencies.
- **Stay informed with
[AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/):** AWS Health is the authoritative source of information about the health of your AWS Cloud resources. Use AWS Health to visualize and receive notifications about any current service events and upcoming changes, such as planned lifecycle events, so you can take steps to mitigate impacts.

[Create purpose-fit AWS Health event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/user-notifications.html) to e-mail and chat channels through [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html), and integrate programatically with [your monitoring and alerting tools through Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html) or the [AWS Health API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
- Plan and track progress on health events that require action by integrating with change management or ITSM tools (like [Jira](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/smc/latest/ag/cloud-sys-health.html) or [ServiceNow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/smc/latest/ag/sn-aws-health.html)) that you may already use through Amazon EventBridge or the AWS Health API.
- If you use AWS Organizations, enable
[organization view for
AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html) to aggregate AWS Health events across accounts.

- **Instrument your application with
[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/):** AWS X-Ray provides insights into
how applications and their underlying dependencies are
performing. By tracing requests from start to end, you can
identify bottlenecks or failures in the external services or
components your application relies on.
- **Use
[Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/):** This machine learning-driven
service identifies operational issues, predicts when
critical issues might occur, and recommends specific actions
to take. It's invaluable for gaining insights into
dependencies and ensuring they're not the source of
operational problems.
- **Monitor regularly:**
Continually monitor metrics and logs related to external
dependencies. Set up alerts for unexpected behavior or
degraded performance.
- **Validate after changes:**
Whenever there's an update or change in any of the external
dependencies, validate their performance and check their
alignment with your application's requirements.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

# OPS04-BP05 Implement distributed tracing

Distributed tracing offers a way to monitor and visualize requests as they traverse through various components of a distributed system. By capturing trace data from multiple sources and analyzing it in a unified view, teams can better understand how requests flow, where bottlenecks exist, and where optimization efforts should focus.

**Desired outcome:** Achieve a holistic view of requests flowing through your distributed system, allowing for precise debugging, optimized performance, and improved user experiences.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Inconsistent instrumentation: Not all services in a distributed system are instrumented for tracing.
- Ignoring latency: Only focusing on errors and not considering the latency or gradual performance degradations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Comprehensive system overview: Visualizing the entire path of requests, from entry to exit.
- Enhanced debugging: Quickly identifying where failures or performance issues occur.
- Improved user experience: Monitoring and optimizing based on actual user data, ensuring the system meets real-world demands.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Begin by identifying all of the elements of your workload that require instrumentation. Once all components are accounted for, leverage tools such as AWS X-Ray and OpenTelemetry to gather trace data for analysis with tools like X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens Map. Engage in regular reviews with developers, and supplement these discussions with tools like Amazon DevOps Guru, X-Ray Analytics and X-Ray Insights to help uncover deeper findings. Establish alerts from trace data to notify when outcomes, as defined in the workload monitoring plan, are at risk.

### Implementation steps

To implement distributed tracing effectively:

- **Adopt [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/):** Integrate X-Ray into your application to gain insights into its behavior, understand its performance, and pinpoint bottlenecks. Utilize X-Ray Insights for automatic trace analysis.
- **Instrument your services:** Verify that every service, from an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function to an [EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), sends trace data. The more services you instrument, the clearer the end-to-end view.
- **Incorporate [CloudWatch Real User Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM.html) and [synthetic monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html):** Integrate Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring with X-Ray. This allows for capturing real-world user experiences and simulating user interactions to identify potential issues.
- **Use the [CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html):** The agent can send traces from either X-Ray or OpenTelemetry, enhancing the depth of insights obtained.
- **Use [Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/):** DevOps Guru uses data from X-Ray, CloudWatch, AWS Config, and AWS CloudTrail to provide actionable recommendations.
- **Analyze traces:** Regularly review the trace data to discern patterns, anomalies, or bottlenecks that might impact your application's performance.
- **Set up alerts:** Configure alarms in [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for unusual patterns or extended latencies, allowing proactive issue addressing.
- **Continuous improvement:** Revisit your tracing strategy as services are added or modified to capture all relevant data points.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

## Question OPS05

# OPS 5 — How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve flow into production?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 10

---

# OPS05-BP01 Use version control

Use version control to activate tracking of changes and releases.

Many AWS services offer version control capabilities. Use a revision
or [source control](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control/) system such as
[Git](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control/git/) to manage code and other artifacts such as
version-controlled
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates of your infrastructure.

**Desired outcome:** Your teams collaborate on code. When merged, the code is consistent and no changes are lost. Errors are easily reverted through correct versioning.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You have been developing and storing your code on your
workstation. You have had an unrecoverable storage failure on
the workstation and your code is lost.
- After overwriting the existing code with your changes, you
restart your application and it is no longer operable. You are
unable to revert the change.
- You have a write lock on a report file that someone else needs
to edit. They contact you asking that you stop work on it so
that they can complete their tasks.
- Your research team has been working on a detailed analysis that
shapes your future work. Someone has accidentally saved
their shopping list over the final report. You are unable to
revert the change and have to recreate the report.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By using version control capabilities you can
easily revert to known good states and previous versions, and limit the
risk of assets being lost.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Maintain assets in version controlled repositories. Doing so supports tracking changes, deploying new versions, detecting changes to existing versions, and reverting to prior versions (for example, rolling back to a known good state in the event of a failure). Integrate the version control capabilities of your configuration management systems into your procedures.

# OPS05-BP02 Test and validate changes

Every change deployed must be tested to avoid errors in production.
This best practice is focused on testing changes from version
control to artifact build. Besides application code changes, testing
should include infrastructure, configuration, security controls, and
operations procedures. Testing takes many forms, from unit tests to
software component analysis (SCA). Move tests further to the left in
the software integration and delivery process results in higher
certainty of artifact quality.

Your organization must develop testing standards for all software
artifacts. Automated tests reduce toil and avoid manual test errors.
Manual tests may be necessary in some cases. Developers must have
access to automated test results to create feedback loops that
improve software quality.

**Desired outcome:** Your software
changes are tested before they are delivered. Developers have access
to test results and validations. Your organization has a testing
standard that applies to all software changes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You deploy a new software change without any tests. It fails to
run in production, which leads to an outage.
- New security groups are deployed with AWS CloudFormation without
being tested in a pre-production environment. The security
groups make your app unreachable for your customers.
- A method is modified but there are no unit tests. The software
fails when it is deployed to production.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Change fail rate of software deployments are
reduced. Software quality is improved. Developers have increased
awareness on the viability of their code. Security policies can be
rolled out with confidence to support organization's compliance.
Infrastructure changes such as automatic scaling policy updates are
tested in advance to meet traffic needs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Testing is done on all changes, from application code to
infrastructure, as part of your continuous integration practice.
Test results are published so that developers have fast feedback.
Your organization has a testing standard that all changes must
pass.

Use the power of generative AI with Amazon Q Developer to improve
developer productivity and code quality. Amazon Q Developer includes
generation of code suggestions (based on large language models),
production of unit tests (including boundary conditions), and code
security enhancements through detection and remediation of security
vulnerabilities.

**Customer example**

As part of their continuous integration pipeline, AnyCompany
Retail conducts several types of tests on all software artifacts.
They practice test driven development so all software has unit
tests. Once the artifact is built, they run end-to-end tests.
After this first round of tests is complete, they run a static
application security scan, which looks for known vulnerabilities.
Developers receive messages as each testing gate is passed. Once
all tests are complete, the software artifact is stored in an
artifact repository.

### Implementation steps

- Work with stakeholders in your organization to develop a
testing standard for software artifacts. What standard tests
should all artifacts pass? Are there compliance or
governance requirements that must be included in the test
coverage? Do you need to conduct code quality tests? When
tests complete, who needs to know?

The
[AWS Deployment Pipeline Reference Architecture](https://pipelines.devops.aws.dev/)
contains an authoritative list of types of tests that
can be conducted on software artifacts as part of an
integration pipeline.

- Instrument your application with the necessary tests based
on your software testing standard. Each set of tests should
complete in under ten minutes. Tests should run as part of
an integration pipeline.

Use
[Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html), a generative AI tool that can help
create unit test cases (including boundary conditions),
generate functions using code and comments, and
implement well-known algorithms.
- Use
[Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html) to test your application code
for defects.
- You can use
[AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html) to conduct tests on software artifacts.
- [AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html) can orchestrate your software tests
into a pipeline.

# OPS05-BP03 Use configuration management systems

Use configuration management systems to make and track configuration changes. These systems reduce errors caused by manual processes and reduce the level of effort to deploy changes.

Static configuration management sets values when initializing a resource that are expected to remain consistent throughout the resource’s lifetime. Dynamic configuration management sets values at initialization that can or are expected to change during the lifetime of a resource. For example, you could set a feature toggle to activate functionality in your code through a configuration change, or change the level of log detail during an incident.

Configurations should be deployed in a known and consistent state. You should use automated inspection to continually monitor resource configurations across environments and regions. These controls should be defined as code and management automated to ensure rules are consistently appplied across environments. Changes to configurations should be updated through agreed change control procedures and applied consistently, honoring version control. Application configuration should be managed independently of application and infrastructure code. This allows for consistent deployment across multiple environments. Configuration changes do not result in rebuilding or redeploying the application.

**Desired outcome:** You configure, validate, and deploy as part of your continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You monitor to validate configurations are correct. This minimizes any impact to end users and customers.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You manually update the web server configuration across your
fleet and a number of servers become unresponsive due to update
errors.
- You manually update your application server fleet over the
course of many hours. The inconsistency in configuration during
the change causes unexpected behaviors.
- Someone has updated your security groups and your web servers
are no longer accessible. Without knowledge of what was changed
you spend significant time investigating the issue extending
your time to recovery.
- You push a pre-production configuration into production through CI/CD without validation. You expose users and customers to incorrect data and services.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Adopting configuration management systems reduces the level of effort to make and track changes, and the frequency of errors caused by manual procedures. Configuration management systems provide assurances with regards to governance, compliance, and regulatory requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Configuration management systems are used to track and implement changes to application and environment configurations. Configuration management systems are also used to reduce errors caused by manual processes, make configuration changes repeatable and auditable, and reduce the level of effort.

On AWS, you can use
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) to continually monitor your AWS resource
configurations
[across
accounts and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/aggregate-data.html). It helps you to track their
configuration history, understand how a configuration change would
affect other resources, and audit them against expected or desired
configurations using
[AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) and
[AWS Config Conformance Packs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html).

For dynamic configurations in your applications running on
Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices, you can use
[AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) to configure, validate, deploy, and monitor them across your environments.

### Implementation steps

- Identify configuration owners.

Make configurations owners aware of any compliance, governance, or regulatory needs.

- Identify configuration items and deliverables.

Configuration items are all application and environmental configurations affected by a deployment within your CI/CD pipeline.
- Deliverables include success criteria, validation, and what to monitor.

- Select tools for configuration management based on your business requirements and delivery pipeline.
- Consider weighted deployments such as canary deployments for significant configuration changes to minimize the impact of incorrect configurations.
- Integrate your configuration management into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Validate all changes pushed.

# OPS05-BP04 Use build and deployment management systems

Use build and deployment management systems. These systems reduce errors caused by manual processes and reduce the level of effort to deploy changes.

In AWS, you can build continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines using services such as
[AWS Developer Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/) (for example,
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/),
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), and
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/)).

**Desired outcome:** Your build and deployment management systems support your organization's continuous integration continuous delivery (CI/CD) system that provide capabilities for automating safe rollouts with the correct configurations.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- After compiling your code on your development system, you copy
the executable onto your production systems and it fails to
start. The local log files indicates that it has failed due to
missing dependencies.
- You successfully build your application with new features in
your development environment and provide the code to quality
assurance (QA). It fails QA because it is missing static assets.
- On Friday, after much effort, you successfully built your
application manually in your development environment including
your newly coded features. On Monday, you are unable to repeat
the steps that allowed you to successfully build your
application.
- You perform the tests you have created for your new release.
Then you spend the next week setting up a test environment and
performing all the existing integration tests followed by the
performance tests. The new code has an unacceptable performance
impact and must be redeveloped and then retested.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By providing mechanisms to manage build and
deployment activities you reduce the level of effort to perform
repetitive tasks, free your team members to focus on their high
value creative tasks, and limit the introduction of error from
manual procedures.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Build and deployment management systems are used to track and implement change, reduce errors caused by manual processes, and reduce the level of effort required for safe deployments. Fully automate the integration and deployment pipeline from code check-in through build, testing, deployment, and validation. This reduces lead time, decreases cost, encourages increased frequency of change, reduces the level of effort, and increases collaboration.

### Implementation steps

*Diagram showing a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and related services*

- Use a version control system to store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files).
- Use CodeBuild to compile your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.
- Use CodeDeploy as a deployment service that automates application deployments to [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances, on-premises instances, [serverless AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html), or [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).
- Monitor your deployments.

# OPS05-BP05 Perform patch management

Perform patch management to gain features, address issues, and remain compliant with governance. Automate patch management to reduce errors caused by manual processes, scale, and reduce the level of effort to patch.

Patch and vulnerability management are part of your benefit and risk
management activities. It is preferable to have immutable
infrastructures and deploy workloads in verified known good states.
Where that is not viable, patching in place is the remaining option.

[AWS Health](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/) is the authoritative source of information about planned lifecycle events and other action-required events that affect the health of your AWS Cloud resources. You should be aware of upcoming changes and updates that should be performed. Major planned lifecycle events are sent at least six months in advance.

[Amazon EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) provides pipelines to update machine images. As a part of patch management, consider [Amazon Machine Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html ) (AMIs) using an [AMI image pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/start-build-image-pipeline.html) or container images with a [Docker image pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/start-build-container-pipeline.html), while AWS Lambda provides patterns for [custom runtimes and additional libraries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) to remove vulnerabilities.

You should manage updates to [Amazon Machine Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) for Linux or Windows Server images using [Amazon EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/). You can use [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) with your existing pipeline to manage Amazon ECS images and manage Amazon EKS images. Lambda includes [version management features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html).

Patching should not be performed on production systems without first
testing in a safe environment. Patches should only be applied if
they support an operational or business outcome. On AWS, you can use
[AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) to automate the process of
patching managed systems and schedule the activity using
[Systems Manager Maintenance Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-maintenance.html).

**Desired outcome:** Your AMI and container images are patched, up-to-date, and ready for launch. You are able to track the status of all deployed images and know patch compliance. You are able to report on current status and have a process to meet your compliance needs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You are given a mandate to apply all new security patches within
two hours resulting in multiple outages due to application
incompatibility with patches.
- An unpatched library results in unintended consequences as
unknown parties use vulnerabilities within it to access your
workload.
- You patch the developer environments automatically without
notifying the developers. You receive multiple complaints from
the developers that their environment cease to operate as
expected.
- You have not patched the commercial off-the-shelf software on a
persistent instance. When you have an issue with the software
and contact the vendor, they notify you that version is not
supported and you have to patch to a specific level to
receive any assistance.
- A recently released patch for the encryption software you used
has significant performance improvements. Your unpatched system
has performance issues that remain in place as a result of not
patching.
- You are notified of a zero-day vulnerability requiring an emergency fix and you have to patch all your environments manually.
- You are not aware of critical actions needed to maintain your resources, such as mandatory version updates because you do not review upcoming planned lifecycle events and other information. You lose critical time for planning and execution, resulting in emergency changes for your teams and potential impact or unexpected downtime.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By establishing a patch management process, including your criteria for patching and methodology for distribution across your environments, you can scale and report on patch levels. This provides assurances around security patching and ensure clear visibility on the status of known fixes being in place. This encourages adoption of desired features and capabilities, the rapid removal of issues, and sustained compliance with governance. Implement patch management systems and automation to reduce the level of effort to deploy patches and limit errors caused by manual processes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Patch systems to remediate issues, to gain desired features or capabilities, and to remain compliant with governance policy and vendor support requirements. In immutable systems, deploy with the appropriate patch set to achieve the desired result. Automate the patch management mechanism to reduce the elapsed time to patch, to avoid errors caused by manual processes, and lower the level of effort to patch.

### Implementation steps

For Amazon EC2 Image Builder:

- Using Amazon EC2 Image Builder, specify pipeline details:

Create an image pipeline and name it
- Define pipeline schedule and time zone
- Configure any dependencies

- Choose a recipe:

Select existing recipe or create a new one
- Select image type
- Name and version your recipe
- Select your base image
- Add build components and add to target registry

- Optional - define your infrastructure configuration.
- Optional - define configuration settings.
- Review settings.
- Maintain recipe hygiene regularly.

For Systems Manager Patch Manager:

- Create a patch baseline.
- Select a patching operations method.
- Enable compliance reporting and scanning.

# OPS05-BP06 Share design standards

Share best practices across teams to increase awareness and maximize the benefits of development efforts. Document them and keep them up to date as your architecture evolves. If shared standards are enforced in your organization, it’s critical that mechanisms exist to request additions, changes, and exceptions to standards. Without this option, standards become a constraint on innovation.

**Desired outcome:** Design standards are shared across teams in your organizations. They are documented and kept up-to-date as best practices evolve.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Two development teams have each created a user authentication service. Your users must maintain a separate set of credentials for each part of the system they want to access.
- Each team manages their own infrastructure. A new compliance requirement forces a change to your infrastructure and each team implements it in a different way.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Using shared standards supports the adoption of best practices and maximizes the benefits of development efforts. Documenting and updating design standards keeps your organization up-to-date with best practices and security and compliance requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Share existing best practices, design standards, checklists, operating procedures, guidance, and governance requirements across teams. Have procedures to request changes, additions, and exceptions to design standards to support improvement and innovation. Make teams are aware of published content. Have a mechanism to keep design standards up-to-date as new best practices emerge.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail has a cross-functional architecture team that creates software architecture patterns. This team builds the architecture with compliance and governance built in. Teams that adopt these shared standards get the benefits of having compliance and governance built in. They can quickly build on top of the design standard. The architecture team meets quarterly to evaluate architecture patterns and update them if necessary.

### Implementation steps

- Identify a cross-functional team that owns developing and updating design standards. This team should work with stakeholders across your organization to develop design standards, operating procedures, checklists, guidance, and governance requirements. Document the design standards and share them within your organization.

[AWS Service Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/introduction.html) can be used to create portfolios representing design standards using infrastructure as code. You can share portfolios across accounts.

- Have a mechanism in place to keep design standards up-to-date as new best practices are identified.
- If design standards are centrally enforced, have a process to request changes, updates, and exemptions.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. Developing a process to create and share design standards can take coordination and cooperation with stakeholders across your organization.

# OPS05-BP07 Implement practices to improve code quality

Implement practices to improve code quality and minimize defects.
Some examples include test-driven development, code reviews,
standards adoption, and pair programming. Incorporate these
practices into your continuous integration and delivery process.

**Desired outcome:** Your
organization uses best practices like code reviews or pair
programming to improve code quality. Developers and operators adopt
code quality best practices as part of the software development
lifecycle.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You commit code to the main branch of your application without a
code review. The change automatically deploys to production and
causes an outage.
- A new application is developed without any unit, end-to-end, or
integration tests. There is no way to test the application
before deployment.
- Your teams make manual changes in production to address defects.
Changes do not go through testing or code reviews and are not
captured or logged through continuous integration and delivery
processes.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By adopting practices to improve code quality,
you can help minimize issues introduced to production. Code quality
best practices include pair programming, code
reviews, and implementation of AI productivity tools.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Implement practices to improve code quality to minimize defects
before they are deployed. Use practices like test-driven
development, code reviews, and pair programming to increase the
quality of your development.

Use the power of generative AI with Amazon Q Developer to improve
developer productivity and code quality. Amazon Q Developer includes
generation of code suggestions (based on large language models),
production of unit tests (including boundary conditions), and code
security enhancements through detection and remediation of security
vulnerabilities.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail adopts several practices to improve code
quality. They have adopted test-driven development as the standard
for writing applications. For some new features, they will have
developers pair program together during a sprint. Every pull
request goes through a code review by a senior developer before
being integrated and deployed.

### Implementation steps

- Adopt code quality practices like test-driven development,
code reviews, and pair programming into your continuous
integration and delivery process. Use these techniques to
improve software quality.

Use
[Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html), a generative AI tool that can help
create unit test cases (including boundary conditions),
generate functions using code and comments, implement
well-known algorithms, detect security policy violations
and vulnerabilities in your code, detect secrets, scan
infrastructure as code (IaC), document code, and learn
third-party code libraries more quickly.
- [Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html) can provide programming
recommendations for Java and Python code using machine
learning.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium. There are many ways of implementing
this best practice, but getting organizational adoption may be
challenging.

# OPS05-BP08 Use multiple environments

Use multiple environments to experiment, develop, and test your
workload. Use increasing levels of controls as environments approach
production to gain confidence your workload operates as intended
when deployed.

**Desired outcome:** You have multiple environments that reflect your compliance and governance needs. You test and promote code through environments on your path to production.

- Your organization does this through the establishment of a landing zone, which provides governance, controls, account automations, networking, security, and operational observability. Manage these landing zone capabilities by using multiple environments. A common example is a sandbox organization for developing and testing changes to an [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/)-based landing zone, which includes [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) and policies such as [service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). All of these elements can significantly impact the access to and operation of AWS accounts within the landing zone.
- In addition to these services, your teams extend the landing zones capabilites with solutions published by AWS and AWS partners or as custom solutions developed within your organization. Examples of solutions published by AWS include [Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CfCT)](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/) and [AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-overview.html).
- Your organization applies the same principles of testing, promoting code, and policy changes for the landing zone through environments on your path to production. This strategy provides a stable and secure landing zone environment for your application and workload teams.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You are performing development in a shared development
environment and another developer overwrites your code changes.
- The restrictive security controls on your shared development
environment are preventing you from experimenting with new
services and features.
- You perform load testing on your production systems and cause an
outage for your users.
- A critical error resulting in data loss has occurred in
production. In your production environment, you attempt to
recreate the conditions that lead to the data loss so that you
can identify how it happened and prevent it from happening
again. To prevent further data loss during testing, you are
forced to make the application unavailable to your users.
- You are operating a multi-tenant service and are unable to
support a customer request for a dedicated environment.
- You may not always test, but when you do, you test in your production environment.
- You believe that the simplicity of a single environment
overrides the scope of impact of changes within the environment.
- You upgrade a key landing zone capability, but the change impairs your team's ability to vend accounts for either new projects or your existing workloads.
- You apply new controls to your AWS accounts, but the change impacts your workload team's ability to deploy changes within their AWS accounts.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** When you deploy multiple environments, you can support multiple simultaneous development, testing, and production environments without creating conflicts between developers or user communities. For complex capabilities such as landing zones, it significantly reduces the risk of changes, simplifies the improvement process, and reduces the risk of critical updates to the environment. Organizations that use landing zones naturally benefit from multi-accounts in their AWS environment, with account structure, governance, network, and security configurations. Over time, as your organization grows, the landing zone can evolve to secure and organize your workloads and resources.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Use multiple environments and provide developers sandbox environments with minimized controls to aid in experimentation. Provide individual development environments to help work in parallel, increasing development agility. Implement more rigorous controls in the environments approaching production to allow developers to innovate. Use infrastructure as code and configuration management systems to deploy environments that are configured consistent with the controls present in production to ensure systems operate as expected when deployed. When environments are not in use, turn them off to avoid costs associated with idle resources (for example, development systems on evenings and weekends). Deploy production equivalent environments when load testing to improve valid results.

Teams such as platform engineering, networking, and security operations often manage capabilies at the organization level with distinct requirements. A separation of accounts alone is insufficient to provide and maintain separate environments for experimentation, development, and testing. In such cases, create separate instances of AWS Organizations.

# OPS05-BP09 Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Frequent, small, and reversible changes reduce the scope and impact of a change. When used in conjunction with change management systems, configuration management systems, and build and delivery systems frequent, small, and reversible changes reduce the scope and impact of a change. This results in more effective troubleshooting and faster remediation with the option to roll back changes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You deploy a new version of your application quarterly with a change window that means a core service is turned off.
- You frequently make changes to your database schema without tracking changes in your management systems.
- You perform manual in-place updates, overwriting existing installations and configurations, and have no clear roll-back plan.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Development efforts are faster by deploying small changes frequently. When the changes are small, it is much easier to identify if they have unintended consequences, and they are easier to reverse. When the changes are reversible, there is less risk to implementing the change, as recovery is simplified. The change process has a reduced risk and the impact of a failed change is reduced.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Use frequent, small, and reversible changes to reduce the scope and impact of a change. This eases troubleshooting, helps with faster remediation, and provides the option to roll back a change. It also increases the rate at which you can deliver value to the business.

# OPS05-BP10 Fully automate integration and deployment

Automate build, deployment, and testing of the workload. This
reduces errors caused by manual processes and reduces the effort to
deploy changes.

Apply metadata using
[Resource
Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) and
[AWS Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) following a consistent
[tagging
strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/) to aid in identification of your resources. Tag your
resources for organization, cost accounting, access controls, and
targeting the run of automated operations activities.

**Desired outcome:** Developers use tools to deliver code and promote through to production. Developers do not have to log into the AWS Management Console to deliver updates. There is a full audit trail of change and configuration, meeting the needs of governance and compliance. Processes are repeatable and are standardized across teams. Developers are free to focus on development and code pushes, increasing productivity.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- On Friday, you finish authoring the new code for your feature
branch. On Monday, after running your code quality test scripts
and each of your unit tests scripts, you check in your code
for the next scheduled release.
- You are assigned to code a fix for a critical issue impacting a
large number of customers in production. After testing the fix,
you commit your code and email change management to request
approval to deploy it to production.
- As a developer, you log into the AWS Management Console to create a new development environment using non-standard methods and systems.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By implementing automated build and deployment management systems, you reduce errors caused by manual processes and reduce the effort to deploy changes helping your team members to focus on delivering business value. You increase the speed of delivery as you promote through to production.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

You use build and deployment management systems to track and implement change, to reduce errors caused by manual processes, and reduce the level of effort. Fully automate the integration and deployment pipeline from code check-in through build, testing, deployment, and validation. This reduces lead time, encourages increased frequency of change, reduces the level of effort, increases the speed to market, results in increased productivity, and increases the security of your code as you promote through to production.

## Question OPS06

# OPS 6 — How do you mitigate deployment risks?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 4

---

# OPS06-BP01 Plan for unsuccessful changes

Plan to revert to a known good state, or remediate in the production environment if the deployment causes an undesired outcome. Having a policy to establish such a plan helps all teams develop strategies to recover from failed changes. Some example strategies are deployment and rollback steps, change policies, feature flags, traffic isolation, and traffic shifting. A single release may include multiple related component changes. The strategy should provide the ability to withstand or recover from a failure of any component change.

**Desired outcome:** You have prepared a detailed recovery plan for your change in the event it is unsuccessful. In addition, you have reduced the size of your release to minimize the potential impact on other workload components. As a result, you have reduced your business impact by shortening the potential downtime caused by a failed change and increased the flexibility and efficiency of recovery times.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You performed a deployment and your application has become unstable but there appear to be active users on the system. You have to decide whether to rollback the change and impact the active users or wait to rollback the change knowing the users may be impacted regardless.
- After making a routine change, your new environments are accessible, but one of your subnets has become unreachable. You have to decide whether to rollback everything or try to fix the inaccessible subnet. While you are making that determination, the subnet remains unreachable.
- Your systems are not architected in a way that allows them to be updated with smaller releases. As a result, you have difficulty in reversing those bulk changes during a failed deployment.
- You do not use infrastructure as code (IaC) and you made manual updates to your infrastructure that resulted in an undesired configuration. You are unable to effectively track and revert the manual changes.
- Because you have not measured increased frequency of your deployments, your team is not incentivized to reduce the size of their changes and improve their rollback plans for each change, leading to more risk and increased failure rates.
- You do not measure the total duration of an outage caused by unsuccessful changes. Your team is unable to prioritize and improve its deployment process and recovery plan effectiveness.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Having a plan to recover from unsuccessful changes minimizes the mean time to recover (MTTR) and reduces your business impact.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

A consistent, documented policy and practice adopted by release teams allows an organization to plan what should happen if unsuccessful changes occur. The policy should allow for fixing forward in specific circumstances. In either situation, a fix forward or rollback plan should be well documented and tested before deployment to live production so that the time it takes to revert a change is minimized.

### Implementation steps

- Document the policies that require teams to have effective plans to reverse changes within a specified period.

Policies should specify when a fix-forward situation is allowed.
- Require a documented rollback plan to be accessible by all involved.
- Specify the requirements to rollback (for example, when it is found that unauthorized changes have been deployed).

- Analyze the level of impact of all changes related to each component of a workload.

Allow repeatable changes to be standardized, templated, and preauthorized if they follow a consistent workflow that enforces change policies.
- Reduce the potential impact of any change by making the size of the change smaller so recovery takes less time and causes less business impact.
- Ensure rollback procedures revert code to the known good state to avoid incidents where possible.

- Integrate tools and workflows to enforce your policies programatically.
- Make data about changes visible to other workload owners to improve the speed of diagnosis of any failed change that cannot be rolled back.

Measure success of this practice using visible change data and identify iterative improvements.

- Use monitoring tools to verify the success or failure of a deployment to speed up decision-making on rolling back.
- Measure your duration of outage during an unsuccessful change to continually improve your recovery plans.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

# OPS06-BP02 Test deployments

Test release procedures in pre-production by using the same deployment configuration, security controls, steps, and procedures as in production. Validate that all deployed steps are completed as expected, such as inspecting files, configurations, and services. Further test all changes with functional, integration, and load tests, along with any monitoring such as health checks. By doing these tests, you can identify deployment issues early with an opportunity to plan and mitigate them prior to production.

You can create temporary parallel environments for testing every change. Automate the deployment of the test environments using infrastructure as code (IaC) to help reduce amount of work involved and ensure stability, consistency, and faster feature delivery.

**Desired outcome:** Your organization adopts a test-driven development culture that includes testing deployments. This ensures teams are focused on delivering business value rather than managing releases. Teams are engaged early upon identification of deployment risks to determine the appropriate course of mitigation.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- During production releases, untested deployments cause frequent issues that require troubleshooting and escalation.
- Your release contains infrastructure as code (IaC) that updates existing resources. You are unsure if the IaC runs successfully or causes impact to the resources.
- You deploy a new feature to your application. It doesn't work as intended and there is no visibility until it gets reported by impacted users.
- You update your certificates. You accidentally install the certificates to the wrong components, which goes undetected and impacts website visitors because a secure connection to the website can't be established.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Extensive testing in pre-production of deployment procedures, and the changes introduced by them, minimizes the potential impact to production caused by the deployments steps. This increases confidence during production release and minimizes operational support without slowing down velocity of the changes being delivered.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Testing your deployment process is as important as testing the changes that result from your deployment. This can be achieved by testing your deployment steps in a pre-production environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Common issues, such as incomplete or incorrect deployment steps, or misconfigurations, can be caught as a result before going to production. In addition, you can test your recovery steps.

**Customer example**

As part of their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, AnyCompany Retail performs the defined steps needed to release infrastructure and software updates for its customers in a production-like environment. The pipeline is comprised of pre-checks to detect drift (detecting changes to resources performed outside of your IaC) in resources prior to deployment, as well as validate actions that the IaC takes upon its initiation. It validates deployment steps, like verifying that certain files and configurations are in place and services are in running states and are responding correctly to health checks on local host before re-registering with the load balancer. Additionally, all changes flag a number of automated tests, such as functional, security, regression, integration, and load tests.

### Implementation steps

- Perform pre-install checks to mirror the pre-production environment to production.

Use [drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html) to detect when resources have been changed outside of CloudFormation.
- Use [change sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html) to validate that the intent of a stack update matches the actions that CloudFormation takes when the change set is initiated.

- This triggers a manual approval step in [AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals.html) to authorize the deployment to the pre-production environment.
- Use deployment configurations such as [AWS CodeDeploy AppSpec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/application-specification-files.html) files to define deployment and validation steps.
- Where applicable, [integrate AWS CodeDeploy with other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-aws.html) or [integrate AWS CodeDeploy with partner product and services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html).
- [Monitor deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/monitoring.html) using Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon SNS event notifications.
- Perform post-deployment automated testing, including functional, security, regression, integration, and load testing.
- [Troubleshoot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html) deployment issues.
- Successful validation of preceding steps should initiate a manual approval workflow to authorize deployment to production.

# OPS06-BP03 Employ safe deployment strategies

Safe production roll-outs control the flow of beneficial changes with an aim to minimize any perceived impact for customers from those changes. The safety controls provide inspection mechanisms to validate desired outcomes and limit the scope of impact from any defects introduced by the changes or from deployment failures. Safe roll-outs may include strategies such as feature-flags, one-box, rolling (canary releases), immutable, traffic splitting, and blue/green deployments.

**Desired outcome:** Your organization uses a continuous integration continuous delivery (CI/CD) system that provides capabilities for automating safe rollouts. Teams are required to use appropriate safe roll-out strategies.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You deploy an unsuccessful change to all of production all at once. As a result, all customers are impacted simultaneously.
- A defect introduced in a simultaneous deployment to all systems requires an emergency release. Correcting it for all customers takes several days.
- Managing production release requires planning and participation of several teams. This puts constraints on your ability to frequently update features for your customers.
- You perform a mutable deployment by modifying your existing systems. After discovering that the change was unsuccessful, you are forced to modify the systems again to restore the old version, extending your time to recovery.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automated deployments balance speed of roll-outs against delivering beneficial changes consistently to customers. Limiting impact prevents costly deployment failures and maximizes teams ability to efficiently respond to failures.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Continuous-delivery failures can lead to reduced service availability and bad customer experiences. To maximize the rate of successful deployments, implement safety controls in the end-to-end release process to minimize deployment errors, with a goal of achieving zero deployment failures.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail is on a mission to achieve minimal to zero downtime deployments, meaning that there's no perceivable impact to its users during deployments. To accomplish this, the company has established deployment patterns (see the following workflow diagram), such as rolling and blue/green deployments. All teams adopt one or more of these patterns in their CI/CD pipeline.

CodeDeploy workflow for Amazon EC2
CodeDeploy workflow for Amazon ECS
CodeDeploy workflow for Lambda

### Implementation steps

- Use an approval workflow to initiate the sequence of production roll-out steps upon promotion to production .
- Use an automated deployment system such as [AWS CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html). AWS CodeDeploy [deployment options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-steps.html) include in-place deployments for EC2/On-Premises and blue/green deployments for EC2/On-Premises, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS (see the preceding workflow diagram).

Where applicable, [integrate AWS CodeDeploy with other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-aws.html) or [integrate AWS CodeDeploy with partner product and services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html).

- Use blue/green deployments for databases such as [Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html) and [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html).
- [Monitor deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/monitoring.html) using Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) event notifications.
- Perform post-deployment automated testing including functional, security, regression, integration, and any load tests.
- [Troubleshoot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html) deployment issues.

# OPS06-BP04 Automate testing and rollback

To increase the speed, reliability, and confidence of your deployment process, have a strategy for automated testing and rollback capabilities in pre-production and production environments. Automate testing when deploying to production to simulate human and system interactions that verify the changes being deployed. Automate rollback to revert back to a previous known good state quickly. The rollback should be initiated automatically on pre-defined conditions such as when the desired outcome of your change is not achieved or when the automated test fails. Automating these two activities improves your success rate for your deployments, minimizes recovery time, and reduces the potential impact to the business.

**Desired outcome:** Your automated tests and rollback strategies are integrated into your continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Your monitoring is able to validate against your success criteria and initiate automatic rollback upon failure. This minimizes any impact to end users and customers. For example, when all testing outcomes have been satisfied, you promote your code into the production environment where automated regression testing is initiated, leveraging the same test cases. If regression test results do not match expectations, then automated rollback is initiated in the pipeline workflow.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your systems are not architected in a way that allows them to be updated with smaller releases. As a result, you have difficulty in reversing those bulk changes during a failed deployment.
- Your deployment process consists of a series of manual steps. After you deploy changes to your workload, you start post-deployment testing. After testing, you realize that your workload is inoperable and customers are disconnected. You then begin rolling back to the previous version. All of these manual steps delay overall system recovery and cause a prolonged impact to your customers.
- You spent time developing automated test cases for functionality that is not frequently used in your application, minimizing the return on investment in your automated testing capability.
- Your release is comprised of application, infrastructure, patches and configuration updates that are independent from one another. However, you have a single CI/CD pipeline that delivers all changes at once. A failure in one component forces you to revert all changes, making your rollback complex and inefficient.
- Your team completes the coding work in sprint one and begins sprint two work, but your plan did not include testing until sprint three. As a result, automated tests revealed defects from sprint one that had to be resolved before testing of sprint two deliverables could be started and the entire release is delayed, devaluing your automated testing.
- Your automated regression test cases for the production release are complete, but you are not monitoring workload health. Since you have no visibility into whether or not the service has restarted, you are not sure if rollback is needed or if it has already occurred.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Automated testing increases the transparency of your testing process and your ability to cover more features in a shorter time period. By testing and validating changes in production, you are able to identify issues immediately. Improvement in consistency with automated testing tools allows for better detection of defects. By automatically rolling back to the previous version, the impact on your customers is minimized. Automated rollback ultimately inspires more confidence in your deployment capabilities by reducing business impact. Overall, these capabilities reduce time-to-delivery while ensuring quality.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Automate testing of deployed environments to confirm desired outcomes more quickly. Automate rollback to a previous known good state when pre-defined outcomes are not achieved to minimize recovery time and reduce errors caused by manual processes. Integrate testing tools with your pipeline workflow to consistently test and minimize manual inputs. Prioritize automating test cases, such as those that mitigate the greatest risks and need to be tested frequently with every change. Additionally, automate rollback based on specific conditions that are pre-defined in your test plan.

### Implementation steps

- Establish a testing lifecycle for your development lifecycle that defines each stage of the testing process from requirements planning to test case development, tool configuration, automated testing, and test case closure.

Create a workload-specific testing approach from your overall test strategy.
- Consider a continuous testing strategy where appropriate throughout the development lifecycle.

- Select automated tools for testing and rollback based on your business requirements and pipeline investments.
- Decide which test cases you wish to automate and which should be performed manually. These can be defined based on business value priority of the feature being tested. Align all team members to this plan and verify accountability for performing manual tests.

Apply automated testing capabilities to specific test cases that make sense for automation, such as repeatable or frequently run cases, those that require repetitive tasks, or those that are required across multiple configurations.
- Define test automation scripts as well as the success criteria in the automation tool so continued workflow automation can be initiated when specific cases fail.
- Define specific failure criteria for automated rollback.

- Prioritize test automation to drive consistent results with thorough test case development where complexity and human interaction have a higher risk of failure.
- Integrate your automated testing and rollback tools into your CI/CD pipeline.

Develop clear success criteria for your changes.
- Monitor and observe to detect these criteria and automatically reverse changes when specific rollback criteria are met.

- Perform different types of automated production testing, such as:

A/B testing to show results in comparison to the current version between two user testing groups.
- Canary testing that allows you to roll out your change to a subset of users before releasing it to all.
- Feature-flag testing which allows a single feature of the new version at a time to be flagged on and off from outside the application so that each new feature can be validated one at a time.
- Regression testing to verify new functionality with existing interrelated components.

- Monitor the operational aspects of the application, transactions, and interactions with other applications and components. Develop reports to show success of changes by workload so that you can identify what parts of the automation and workflow can be further optimized.

Develop test result reports that help you make quick decisions on whether or not rollback procedures should be invoked.
- Implement a strategy that allows for automated rollback based upon pre-defined failure conditions that result from one or more of your test methods.

- Develop your automated test cases to allow for reusability across future repeatable changes.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium

## Question OPS07

# OPS 7 — How do you know that you are ready to support a workload?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 6

---

# OPS07-BP01 Ensure personnel capability

Have a mechanism to validate that you have the appropriate number of trained personnel to support the workload. They must be trained on the platform and services that make up your workload. Provide them with the knowledge necessary to operate the workload. You must have enough trained personnel to support the normal operation of the workload and troubleshoot any incidents that occur. Have enough personnel so that you can rotate during on-call and vacations to avoid burnout.

**Desired outcome:**

- There are enough trained personnel to support the workload at times when the workload is available.
- You provide training for your personnel on the software and services that make up your workload.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying a workload without team members trained to operate the platform and services in use.
- Not having enough personnel to support on-call rotations or personnel taking time off.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Having skilled team members helps effective support of your workload.
- With enough team members, you can support the workload and on-call rotations while decreasing the risk of burnout.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Validate that there are sufficient trained personnel to support the workload. Verify that you have enough team members to cover normal operational activities, including on-call rotations.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail makes sure that teams supporting the workload are properly staffed and trained. They have enough engineers to support an on-call rotation. Personnel get training on the software and platform that the workload is built on and are encouraged to earn certifications. There are enough personnel so that people can take time off while still supporting the workload and the on-call rotation.

### Implementation steps

- Assign an adequate number of personnel to operate and support your workload, including on-call duties, security issues, and lifecycle events, such as end of support and certificate rotation tasks.
- Train your personnel on the software and platforms that compose your workload.

[AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) has a library of courses about AWS. They provide free and paid courses, online and in-person.
- [AWS hosts events and webinars](https://aws.amazon.com/events/) where you learn from AWS experts.

- Perform the following on a regular basis:

Evaluate team size and skills as operating conditions and the workload change.
- Adjust team size and skills to match operational requirements.
- Verify ability and capacity to [address planned lifecycle events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aws-health-planned-lifecycle-events.html), unplanned security, and operational notifications through AWS Health.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** High. Hiring and training a team to support a workload can take significant effort but has substantial long-term benefits.

## Resources

# OPS07-BP02 Ensure a consistent review of operational readiness

Use Operational Readiness Reviews (ORRs) to validate that you can
operate your workload. ORR is a mechanism developed at Amazon to
validate that teams can safely operate their workloads. An ORR is a
review and inspection process using a checklist of requirements. An
ORR is a self-service experience that teams use to certify their
workloads. ORRs include best practices from lessons learned from our
years of building software.

An ORR checklist is composed of architectural recommendations, operational process, event
management, and release quality. Our Correction of Error (CoE) process is a major driver of
these items. Your own post-incident analysis should drive the evolution of your own ORR. An ORR
is not only about following best practices but preventing the recurrence of events that you’ve
seen before. Lastly, security, governance, and compliance requirements can also be included in
an ORR.

Run ORRs before a workload launches to general availability and then throughout the
software development lifecycle. Running the ORR before launch increases your ability to operate
the workload safely. Periodically re-run your ORR on the workload to catch any drift from best
practices. You can have ORR checklists for new services launches and ORRs for periodic reviews.
This helps keep you up to date on new best practices that arise and incorporate lessons learned
from post-incident analysis. As your use of the cloud matures, you can build ORR requirements
into your architecture as defaults.

**Desired outcome:**  You have an ORR
checklist with best practices for your organization. ORRs are
conducted before workloads launch. ORRs are run periodically over
the course of the workload lifecycle.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You launch a workload without knowing if you can operate it.
- Governance and security requirements are not included in certifying a workload for
launch.
- Workloads are not re-evaluated periodically.
- Workloads launch without required procedures in place.
- You see repetition of the same root cause failures in multiple workloads.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Your workloads include architecture, process, and management
best practices.
- Lessons learned are incorporated into your ORR process.
- Required procedures are in place when workloads launch.
- ORRs are run throughout the software lifecycle of your
workloads.

**Level of risk if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

An ORR is two things: a process and a checklist. Your ORR process should be adopted by
your organization and supported by an executive sponsor. At a minimum, ORRs must be conducted
before a workload launches to general availability. Run the ORR throughout the software
development lifecycle to keep it up to date with best practices or new requirements. The ORR
checklist should include configuration items, security and governance requirements, and best
practices from your organization. Over time, you can use services, such as [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html),
[AWS Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html), and [AWS Control Tower Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/guardrails.html), to
build best practices from the ORR into guardrails for automatic detection of best practices.

**Customer example**

After several production incidents, AnyCompany Retail decided to
implement an ORR process. They built a checklist composed of best
practices, governance and compliance requirements, and lessons
learned from outages. New workloads conduct ORRs before they
launch. Every workload conducts a yearly ORR with a subset of best
practices to incorporate new best practices and requirements that
are added to the ORR checklist. Over time, AnyCompany Retail used
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) to detect some best practices, speeding up the ORR
process.

**Implementation steps**

To learn more about ORRs, read the
[Operational
Readiness Reviews (ORR) whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/wa-operational-readiness-reviews.html). It provides detailed
information on the history of the ORR process, how to build your
own ORR practice, and how to develop your ORR checklist. The
following steps are an abbreviated version of that document. For
an in-depth understanding of what ORRs are and how to build your
own, we recommend reading that whitepaper.

- Gather the key stakeholders together, including representatives from security,
operations, and development.
- Have each stakeholder provide at least one requirement. For the first iteration, try
to limit the number of items to thirty or less.

[Appendix
B: Example ORR questions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/appendix-b-example-orr-questions.html) from the Operational
Readiness Reviews (ORR) whitepaper contains sample
questions that you can use to get started.

- Collect your requirements into a spreadsheet.

You can use [custom lenses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/lenses-custom.html) in
the [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchiected/) to develop your ORR
and share them across your accounts and AWS Organization.

- Identify one workload to conduct the ORR on. A pre-launch workload or an internal
workload is ideal.
- Run through the ORR checklist and take note of any discoveries made. Discoveries might
be acceptable if a mitigation is in place. For any discovery that lacks a mitigation, add
those to your backlog of items and implement them before launch.
- Continue to add best practices and requirements to your ORR checklist over time.

Support customers with Enterprise Support can request the [Operational Readiness
Review Workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology-and-programs/proactive-services/) from their Technical Account Manager. The workshop is an interactive
*working backwards* session to develop your own ORR
checklist.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** High. Adopting an ORR practice in your
organization requires executive sponsorship and stakeholder
buy-in. Build and update the checklist with inputs from across
your organization.

# OPS07-BP03 Use runbooks to perform procedures

A *runbook* is a documented process to achieve a
specific outcome. Runbooks consist of a series of steps that someone
follows to get something done. Runbooks have been used in operations
going back to the early days of aviation. In cloud operations, we
use runbooks to reduce risk and achieve desired outcomes. At its
simplest, a runbook is a checklist to complete a task.

Runbooks are an essential part of operating your workload. From
onboarding a new team member to deploying a major release, runbooks
are the codified processes that provide consistent outcomes no
matter who uses them. Runbooks should be published in a central
location and updated as the process evolves, as updating runbooks is
a key component of a change management process. They should also
include guidance on error handling, tools, permissions, exceptions,
and escalations in case a problem occurs.

As your organization matures, begin automating runbooks. Start with
runbooks that are short and frequently used. Use scripting languages
to automate steps or make steps easier to perform. As you automate
the first few runbooks, you'll dedicate time to automating more
complex runbooks. Over time, most of your runbooks should be
automated in some way.

**Desired outcome:** Your team has a
collection of step-by-step guides for performing workload tasks. The
runbooks contain the desired outcome, necessary tools and
permissions, and instructions for error handling. They are stored in
a central location (version control system) and updated frequently.
For example, your runbooks provide capabilities for your teams to
monitor, communicate, and respond to AWS Health events for critical
accounts during application alarms, operational issues, and planned
lifecycle events.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Relying on memory to complete each step of a process.
- Manually deploying changes without a checklist.
- Different team members performing the same process but with
different steps or outcomes.
- Letting runbooks drift out of sync with system changes and
automation.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reducing error rates for manual tasks.
- Operations are performed in a consistent manner.
- New team members can start performing tasks sooner.
- Runbooks can be automated to reduce toil.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Runbooks can take several forms depending on the maturity level of
your organization. At a minimum, they should consist of a
step-by-step text document. The desired outcome should be clearly
indicated. Clearly document necessary special permissions or
tools. Provide detailed guidance on error handling and escalations
in case something goes wrong. List the runbook owner and publish
it in a central location. Once your runbook is documented,
validate it by having someone else on your team run it. As
procedures evolve, update your runbooks in accordance with your
change management process.

Your text runbooks should be automated as your organization
matures. Using services like
[AWS Systems Manager automations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html), you can transform flat text
into automations that can be run against your workload. These
automations can be run in response to events, reducing the
operational burden to maintain your workload. AWS Systems Manager
Automation also provides a low-code
[visual
design experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-visual-designer.html) to create automation runbooks more
easily.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail must perform database schema updates during
software deployments. The Cloud Operations Team worked with the
Database Administration Team to build a runbook for manually
deploying these changes. The runbook listed each step in the
process in checklist form. It included a section on error handling
in case something went wrong. They published the runbook on their
internal wiki along with their other runbooks. The Cloud
Operations Team plans to automate the runbook in a future sprint.

### Implementation steps

If you don't have an existing document
repository, a version control repository is a great place to start
building your runbook library. You can build your runbooks using
Markdown. We have provided an example runbook template that you
can use to start building runbooks.

```
`# Runbook Title
## Runbook Info
| Runbook ID | Description | Tools Used | Special Permissions | Runbook Author | Last Updated | Escalation POC |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| RUN001 | What is this runbook for? What is the desired outcome? | Tools | Permissions | Your Name | 2022-09-21 | Escalation Name |
## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two`
```

- If you don't have an existing documentation repository or
wiki, create a new version control repository in your version
control system.
- Identify a process that does not have a runbook. An ideal
process is one that is conducted semiregularly, short in
number of steps, and has low impact failures.
- In your document repository, create a new draft Markdown
document using the template. Fill in Runbook Title and the
required fields under Runbook Info.
- Starting with the first step, fill in the Steps portion of the
runbook.
- Give the runbook to a team member. Have them use the runbook
to validate the steps. If something is missing or needs
clarity, update the runbook.
- Publish the runbook to your internal documentation store. Once
published, tell your team and other stakeholders.
- Over time, you'll build a library of runbooks. As that library
grows, start working to automate runbooks.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Low. The minimum standard for a runbook is a
step-by-step text guide. Automating runbooks can increase the
implementation effort.

# OPS07-BP04 Use playbooks to investigate issues

*Playbooks* are step-by-step guides used to investigate an incident.
When incidents happen, playbooks are used to investigate, scope
impact, and identify a root cause. Playbooks are used for a variety
of scenarios, from failed deployments to security incidents. In many
cases, playbooks identify the root cause that a runbook is used to
mitigate. Playbooks are an essential component of your
organization's incident response plans.

A good playbook has several key features. It guides the user, step
by step, through the process of discovery. Thinking outside-in, what
steps should someone follow to diagnose an incident? Clearly define
in the playbook if special tools or elevated permissions are needed
in the playbook. Having a communication plan to update stakeholders
on the status of the investigation is a key component. In situations
where a root cause can't be identified, the playbook should have an
escalation plan. If the root cause is identified, the playbook
should point to a runbook that describes how to resolve it.
Playbooks should be stored centrally and regularly maintained. If
playbooks are used for specific alerts, provide your team with
pointers to the playbook within the alert.

As your organization matures, automate your playbooks. Start with
playbooks that cover low-risk incidents. Use scripting to automate
the discovery steps. Make sure that you have companion runbooks to
mitigate common root causes.

**Desired outcome:** Your
organization has playbooks for common incidents. The playbooks are
stored in a central location and available to your team members.
Playbooks are updated frequently. For any known root causes,
companion runbooks are built.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- There is no standard way to investigate an incident.
- Team members rely on muscle memory or institutional knowledge to
troubleshoot a failed deployment.
- New team members learn how to investigate issues through trial
and error.
- Best practices for investigating issues are not shared across
teams.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Playbooks boost your efforts to mitigate incidents.
- Different team members can use the same playbook to identify a
root cause in a consistent manner.
- Known root causes can have runbooks developed for them, speeding
up recovery time.
- Playbooks help team members to start contributing sooner.
- Teams can scale their processes with repeatable playbooks.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

How you build and use playbooks depends on the maturity of your
organization. If you are new to the cloud, build playbooks in text
form in a central document repository. As your organization
matures, playbooks can become semi-automated with scripting
languages like Python. These scripts can be run inside a Jupyter
notebook to speed up discovery. Advanced organizations have fully
automated playbooks for common issues that are auto-remediated
with runbooks.

Start building your playbooks by listing common incidents that
happen to your workload. Choose playbooks for incidents that are
low risk and where the root cause has been narrowed down to a few
issues to start. After you have playbooks for simpler scenarios,
move on to the higher risk scenarios or scenarios where the root
cause is not well known.

Your text playbooks should be automated as your organization
matures. Using services like
[AWS Systems Manager Automations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html), flat text can be transformed
into automations. These automations can be run against your
workload to speed up investigations. These automations can be
activated in response to events, reducing the mean time to
discover and resolve incidents.

Customers can use
[AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-incident-manager.html) to respond to incidents.
This service provides a single interface to triage incidents,
inform stakeholders during discovery and mitigation, and
collaborate throughout the incident. It uses AWS Systems Manager
Automations to speed up detection and recovery.

**Customer example**

A production incident impacted AnyCompany Retail. The on-call
engineer used a playbook to investigate the issue. As they
progressed through the steps, they kept the key stakeholders,
identified in the playbook, up to date. The engineer identified
the root cause as a race condition in a backend service. Using a
runbook, the engineer relaunched the service, bringing AnyCompany
Retail back online.

### Implementation steps

If you don't have an existing document repository, we suggest
creating a version control repository for your playbook library.
You can build your playbooks using Markdown, which is compatible
with most playbook automation systems. If you are starting from
scratch, use the following example playbook template.

```
`# Playbook Title
## Playbook Info
| Playbook ID | Description | Tools Used | Special Permissions | Playbook Author | Last Updated | Escalation POC | Stakeholders | Communication Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| RUN001 | What is this playbook for? What incident is it used for? | Tools | Permissions | Your Name | 2022-09-21 | Escalation Name | Stakeholder Name | How will updates be communicated during the investigation? |
## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two`
```

- If you don't have an existing document repository or wiki,
create a new version control repository for your playbooks
in your version control system.
- Identify a common issue that requires investigation. This
should be a scenario where the root cause is limited to a
few issues and resolution is low risk.
- Using the Markdown template, fill in the Playbook Name
section and the fields under Playbook Info.
- Fill in the troubleshooting steps. Be as clear as possible
on what actions to perform or what areas you should
investigate.
- Give a team member the playbook and have them go through it
to validate it. If there's anything missing or something
isn't clear, update the playbook.
- Publish your playbook in your document repository and inform
your team and any stakeholders.
- This playbook library will grow as you add more playbooks.
Once you have several playbooks, start automating them using
tools like AWS Systems Manager Automations to keep
automation and playbooks in sync.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Low. Your playbooks should be text documents
stored in a central location. More mature organizations will
move towards automating playbooks.

# OPS07-BP05 Make informed decisions to deploy systems and changes

Have processes in place for successful and unsuccessful changes to your workload. A pre-mortem is an exercise where a team simulates a failure to develop mitigation strategies. Use pre-mortems to anticipate failure and create procedures where appropriate. Evaluate the benefits and risks of deploying changes to your workload. Verify that all changes comply with governance.

**Desired outcome:**

- You make informed decisions when deploying changes to your workload.
- Changes comply with governance.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying a change to our workload without a process to handle a failed deployment.
- Making changes to your production environment that are out of compliance with governance requirements.
- Deploying a new version of your workload without establishing a baseline for resource utilization.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- You are prepared for unsuccessful changes to your workload.
- Changes to your workload are compliant with governance policies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Use pre-mortems to develop processes for unsuccessful changes. Document your processes for unsuccessful changes. Ensure that all changes comply with governance. Evaluate the benefits and risks to deploying changes to your workload.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail regularly conducts pre-mortems to validate their processes for unsuccessful changes. They document their processes in a shared Wiki and update it frequently. All changes comply with governance requirements.

**Implementation steps**

- Make informed decisions when deploying changes to your workload. Establish and review criteria for a successful deployment. Develop scenarios or criteria that would initiate a rollback of a change. Weigh the benefits of deploying changes against the risks of an unsuccessful change.
- Verify that all changes comply with governance policies.
- Use pre-mortems to plan for unsuccessful changes and document mitigation strategies. Run a table-top exercise to model an unsuccessful change and validate roll-back procedures.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Moderate. Implementing a practice of pre-mortems requires coordination and effort from stakeholders across your organization

# OPS07-BP06 Create support plans for production workloads

Enable support for any software and services that your production workload relies on.
Select an appropriate support level to meet your production service-level needs.
Support plans for these dependencies are necessary in case there is a service
disruption or software issue. Document support plans and how to request support
for all service and software vendors. Implement mechanisms that verify that
support points of contacts are kept up to date.

**Desired outcome:**

- Implement support plans for software and services that production workloads rely on.
- Choose an appropriate support plan based on service-level needs.
- Document the support plans, support levels, and how to request support.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You have no support plan for a critical software vendor. Your workload
is impacted by them and you can do nothing to expedite a fix or get
timely updates from the vendor.
- A developer that was the primary point of contact for a software vendor left
the company. You are not able to reach the vendor support directly. You must
spend time researching and navigating generic contact systems, increasing the
time required to respond when needed.
- A production outage occurs with a software vendor. There is no documentation on
how to file a support case.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- With the appropriate support level, you are able to get a response in the time frame necessary to meet service-level needs.
- As a supported customer you can escalate if there are production issues.
- Software and services vendors can assist in troubleshooting during an incident.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Enable support plans for any software and services vendors that your production workload
relies on. Set up appropriate support plans to meet service-level needs. For AWS customers,
this means activating AWS Business Support or greater on any accounts where you have production
workloads. Meet with support vendors on a regular cadence to get updates about support
offerings, processes, and contacts. Document how to request support from software and
services vendors, including how to escalate if there is an outage. Implement mechanisms
to keep support contacts up to date.

**Customer example**

At AnyCompany Retail, all commercial software and services dependencies have support plans.
For example, they have AWS Enterprise Support activated on all accounts with production workloads.
Any developer can raise a support case when there is an issue. There is a wiki page with
information on how to request support, whom to notify, and best practices for expediting a case.

**Implementation steps**

- Work with stakeholders in your organization to identify software and services vendors that your workload relies on. Document these dependencies.
- Determine service-level needs for your workload. Select a support plan that aligns with them.
- For commercial software and services, establish a support plan with the vendors.

Subscribing to AWS Business Support or greater for all production accounts provides faster
response time from AWS Support and strongly recommended. If you don’t have premium support,
you must have an action plan to handle issues, which require help from AWS Support. AWS Support
provides a mix of tools and technology, people, and programs designed to proactively help
you optimize performance, lower costs, and innovate faster. In addition, AWS Business Support provides
additional benefits, including API access to AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Health for programmatic integration with your systems, alongside other access methods like the AWS Management Console and Amazon EventBridge channels.

- Document the support plan in your knowledge management tool. Include how to request support,
who to notify if a support case is filed, and how to escalate during an incident. A wiki is
a good mechanism to allow anyone to make necessary updates to documentation when they become
aware of changes to support processes or contacts.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Low. Most software and services vendors
offer opt-in support plans. Documenting and sharing support best practices on your knowledge management system
verifies that your team knows what to do when there is a production issue.

# OPS08-BP04 Create actionable alerts

Promptly detecting and responding to deviations in your
application's behavior is crucial. Especially vital is recognizing
when outcomes based on key performance indicators (KPIs) are at risk
or when unexpected anomalies arise. Basing alerts on KPIs ensures
that the signals you receive are directly tied to business or
operational impact. This approach to actionable alerts promotes
proactive responses and helps maintain system performance and
reliability.

**Desired outcome:** Receive timely,
relevant, and actionable alerts for rapid identification and
mitigation of potential issues, especially when KPI outcomes are at
risk.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Setting up too many non-critical alerts, leading to alert
fatigue.
- Not prioritizing alerts based on KPIs, making it hard to
understand the business impact of issues.
- Neglecting to address root causes, leading to repetitive alerts
for the same issue.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduced alert fatigue by focusing on actionable and relevant
alerts.
- Improved system uptime and reliability through proactive issue
detection and mitigation.
- Enhanced team collaboration and quicker issue resolution by
integrating with popular alerting and communication tools.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To create an effective alerting mechanism, it's vital to use
metrics, logs, and trace data that flag when outcomes based on
KPIs are at risk or anomalies are detected.

### Implementation steps

- **Determine key performance indicators
(KPIs)**: Identify your application's KPIs. Alerts
should be tied to these KPIs to reflect the business impact
accurately.
- **Implement anomaly
detection**:

**Use Amazon CloudWatch anomaly
detection**: Set up
[Amazon CloudWatch anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Anomaly_Detection.html) to automatically
detect unusual patterns, which helps you only generate
alerts for genuine anomalies.
- **Use AWS X-Ray Insights**:

Set up
[X-Ray
Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-insights.html) to detect anomalies in trace data.
- Configure
[notifications
for X-Ray Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-insights.html#xray-console-insight-notifications) to be alerted on detected
issues.

- **Integrate with Amazon DevOps Guru**:

Leverage
[Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/) for its machine learning
capabilities in detecting operational anomalies with
existing data.
- Navigate to the
[notification
settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/update-notifications.html#navigate-to-notification-settings) in DevOps Guru to set up anomaly
alerts.

- **Implement actionable
alerts**: Design alerts that provide adequate
information for immediate action.

Monitor
[AWS Health events with Amazon EventBridge rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html), or
integrate programatically with the AWS Health API to
automate actions when you receive AWS Health events.
These can be general actions, such as sending all
planned lifecycle event messages to a chat interface, or
specific actions, such as the initiation of a workflow
in an IT service management tool.

- **Reduce alert fatigue**:
Minimize non-critical alerts. When teams are overwhelmed
with numerous insignificant alerts, they can lose oversight
of critical issues, which diminishes the overall
effectiveness of the alert mechanism.
- **Set up composite alarms**:
Use
[Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms](https://aws.amazon.com/bloprove-monitoring-efficiency-using-amazon-cloudwatch-composite-alarms-2/) to consolidate multiple
alarms.
- **Integrate with alert
tools**: Incorporate tools like
[Ops
Genie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) and
[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).
- **Engage Amazon Q Developer in chat applications**:
Integrate
[Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](https://aws.amazon.com/chatbot/) to relay alerts to Amazon Chime, Microsoft Teams,
and Slack.
- **Alert based on logs**: Use
[log
metric filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html) in CloudWatch to create alarms based
on specific log events.
- **Review and iterate**:
Regularly revisit and refine alert configurations.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

# OPS08-BP05 Create dashboards

Dashboards are the human-centric view into the telemetry data of
your workloads. While they provide a vital visual interface, they
should not replace alerting mechanisms, but complement them. When
crafted with care, not only can they offer rapid insights into
system health and performance, but they can also present
stakeholders with real-time information on business outcomes and the
impact of issues.

**Desired outcome:**

Clear, actionable insights into system and business health using
visual representations.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Overcomplicating dashboards with too many metrics.
- Relying on dashboards without alerts for anomaly detection.
- Not updating dashboards as workloads evolve.

**Benefits of this best practice:**

- Immediate visibility into critical system metrics and KPIs.
- Enhanced stakeholder communication and understanding.
- Rapid insight into the impact of operational issues.

**Level of risk if this best practice isn't
established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

**Business-centric dashboards**

Dashboards tailored to business KPIs engage a wider array of
stakeholders. While these individuals might not be interested in
system metrics, they are keen on understanding the business
implications of these numbers. A business-centric dashboard
ensures that all technical and operational metrics being monitored
and analyzed are in sync with overarching business goals. This
alignment provides clarity, ensuring everyone is on the same page
regarding what's essential and what's not. Additionally,
dashboards that highlight business KPIs tend to be more
actionable. Stakeholders can quickly understand the health of
operations, areas that need attention, and the potential impact on
business outcomes.

With this in mind, when creating your dashboards, ensure that
there's a balance between technical metrics and business KPIs.
Both are vital, but they cater to different audiences. Ideally,
you should have dashboards that provide a holistic view of the
system's health and performance while also emphasizing key
business outcomes and their implications.

Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards are customizable home pages in the
CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a
single view, even those resources that are spread across different
AWS Regions and accounts.

### Implementation steps

- **Create a basic dashboard:**
[Create
a new dashboard in CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.html), giving it a
descriptive name.
- **Use Markdown widgets:**
Before diving into the metrics,
[use
Markdown widgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_text_dashboard.html) to add textual context at the top of
your dashboard. This should explain what the dashboard
covers, the significance of the represented metrics, and can
also contain links to other dashboards and troubleshooting
tools.
- **Create dashboard
variables:**
[Incorporate
dashboard variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_dashboard_variables.html) where appropriate to allow for
dynamic and flexible dashboard views.
- **Create metrics widgets:**
[Add
metric widgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-and-work-with-widgets.html) to visualize various metrics your
application emits, tailoring these widgets to effectively
represent system health and business outcomes.
- **Log Insights queries:**
Utilize
[CloudWatch
Log Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_ExportQueryResults.html) to derive actionable metrics from your
logs and display these insights on your dashboard.
- **Set up alarms:** Integrate
[CloudWatch
Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_remove_alarm_dashboard.html) into your dashboard for a quick view of any
metrics breaching their thresholds.
- **Use Contributor Insights:**
Incorporate
[CloudWatch
Contributor Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights-ViewReports.html) to analyze high-cardinality
fields and get a clearer understanding of your resource's
top contributors.
- **Design custom widgets:**
For specific needs not met by standard widgets, consider
creating
[custom
widgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.html). These can pull from various data sources or
represent data in unique ways.
- **Use AWS Health:** AWS Health is the authoritative source of information about the health of your AWS Cloud resources. Use [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) out of the box, or use AWS Health data in your own dashboards and tools so you have the right information available to make informed decisions.
- **Iterate and refine:** As
your application evolves, regularly revisit your dashboard
to ensure its relevance.

## Question OPS09

# OPS 9 — How do you understand the health of your operations?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 3

---

# OPS09-BP01 Measure operations goals and KPIs with metrics

Obtain goals and KPIs that define operations success from your organization and determine that metrics reflect these. Set baselines as a point of reference and reevaluate regularly. Develop mechanisms to collect these metrics from teams for evaluation. The [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) metrics provide a popular method to measure progress towards DevOps practices of software delivery.

**Desired outcome:**

- The organization publishes and shares the goals and KPIs for the operations teams.
- You establish metrics that reflect these KPIs. Examples may include:

Ticket queue depth or average age of ticket
- Ticket count grouped by type of issue
- Time spent working issues with or without a standardized operating procedure (SOP)
- Amount of time spent recovering from a failed code push
- Call volume

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deployment deadlines are missed because developers are pulled away to perform troubleshooting tasks. Development teams argue for more personnel, but cannot quantify how many they need because the time taken away cannot be measured.
- A Tier 1 desk was set up to handle user calls. Over time, more workloads were added, but no headcount was allocated to the Tier 1 desk. Customer satisfaction suffers as call times increase and issues go longer without resolution, but management sees no indicators of such, preventing any action.
- A problematic workload has been handed off to a separate operations team for upkeep. Unlike other workloads, this new one was not supplied with proper documentation and runbooks. As such, teams spend longer troubleshooting and addressing failures. However, there are no metrics documenting this, which makes accountability difficult.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Where workload monitoring shows the state of our applications and services, monitoring operations teams provides owners insight into changes among the consumers of those workloads, such as shifting business needs. Measure the effectiveness of these teams and evaluate them against business goals by creating metrics that can reflect the state of operations. Metrics can highlight support issues or identify when drifts occur away from a service level target.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Schedule time with business leaders and stakeholders to determine what the overall goals of the service will be. Determine what the tasks of various operations teams should be and what challenges they could be approached with. Using these, brainstorm key performance indicators (KPIs) that might reflect these operations goals. These might be customer satisfaction, time from feature conception to deployment, average issue resolution time, or cost efficiencies.

Working from KPIs, identify the metrics and sources of data that might reflect these goals best. Customer satisfaction may be an combination of various metrics such as call wait or response times, satisfaction scores, and types of issues raised. Deployment times may be the sum of time needed for testing and deployment, plus any post-deployment fixes that needed to be added. Statistics showing the time spent on different types of issues (or the counts of those issues) can provide a window into where targeted effort is needed.

# OPS09-BP02 Communicate status and trends to ensure visibility into operation

Knowing the state of your operations and its trending direction is necessary to identify when outcomes may be at risk, whether or not added work can be supported, or the effects that changes have had to your teams. During operations events, having status pages that users and operations teams can refer to for information can reduce pressure on communication channels and disseminate information proactively.

**Desired outcome:**

- Operations leaders have insight at a glance to see what sort of call volumes their teams are operating under and what efforts may be under way, such as deployments.
- Alerts are disseminated to stakeholders and user communities when impacts to normal operations occur.
- Organization leadership and stakeholders can check a status page in response to an alert or impact, and obtain information surrounding an operational event, such as points of contact, ticket information, and estimated recovery times.
- Reports are made available to leadership and other stakeholders to show operations statistics such as call volumes over a period of time, user satisfaction scores, numbers of outstanding tickets and their ages.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- A workload goes down, leaving a service unavailable. Call volumes spike as users request to know what's going on. Managers add to the volume requesting to know who's working an issue. Various operations teams duplicate efforts in trying to investigate.
- A desire for a new capability leads to several personnel being reassigned to an engineering effort. No backfill is provided, and issue resolution times spike. This information is not captured, and only after several weeks and dissatisfied user feedback does leadership become aware of the issue.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** During operational events where the business is impacted, much time and energy can be wasted querying information from various teams attempting to understand the situation. By establishing widely-disseminated status pages and dashboards, stakeholders can quickly obtain information such as whether or not an issue was detected, who has lead on the issue, or when a return to normal operations may be expected. This frees team members from spending too much time communicating status to others and more time addressing issues.

In addition, dashboards and reports can provide insights to decision-makers and stakeholders to see how operations teams are able to respond to business needs and how their resources are being allocated. This is crucial for determining if adequate resources are in place to support the business.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Build dashboards that show the current key metrics for your ops teams, and make them readily accessible both to operations leaders and management.

Build status pages that can be updated quickly to show when an incident or event is unfolding, who has ownership and who is coordinating the response. Share any steps or workarounds that users should consider on this page, and disseminate the location widely. Encourage users to check this location first when confronted with an unknown issue.

Collect and provide reports that show the health of operations over time, and distribute this to leaders and decision makers to illustrate the work of operations along with challenges and needs.

Share between teams these metrics and reports that best reflect goals and KPIs and where they have been influential in driving change. Dedicate time to these activities to elevate the importance of operations inside of and between teams.

Use [AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html) alongside your own dashboards, or integrate AWS Health events into them, so that your teams can correlate application issues to AWS service status.

# OPS09-BP03 Review operations metrics and prioritize improvement

Setting aside dedicated time and resources for reviewing the state of operations ensures that serving the day-to-day line of business remains a priority. Pull together operations leaders and stakeholders to regularly review metrics, reaffirm or modify goals and objectives, and prioritize improvements.

**Desired outcome:**

- Operations leaders and staff regularly meet to review metrics over a given reporting period. Challenges are communicated, wins are celebrated, and lessons learned are shared.
- Stakeholders and business leaders are regularly briefed on the state of operations and solicited for input regarding goals, KPIs, and future initiatives. Tradeoffs between service delivery, operations, and maintenance are discussed and placed into context.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- A new product is launched, but the Tier 1 and Tier 2 operations teams are not adequately trained to support or given additional staff. Metrics that show the decrease in ticket resolution times and increase in incident volumes are not seen by leaders. Action is taken weeks later when subscription numbers start to fall as discontent users move off the platform.
- A manual process for performing maintenance on a workload has been in place for a long time. While a desire to automate has been present, this was a low priority given the low importance of the system. Over time however, the system has grown in importance and now these manual processes consume a majority of operations' time. No resources are scheduled for providing increased tooling to operations, leading to staff burnout as workloads increase. Leadership becomes aware once it's reported that staff are leaving for other competitors.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** In some organizations, it can become a challenge to allocate the same time and attention that is afforded to service delivery and new products or offerings. When this occurs, the line of business can suffer as the level of service expected slowly deteriorates. This is because operations does not change and evolve with the growing business, and can soon be left behind. Without regular review into the insights operations collects, the risk to the business may become visible only when it's too late. By allocating time to review metrics and procedures both among the operations staff and with leadership, the crucial role operations plays remains visible, and risks can be identified long before they reach critical levels. Operations teams get better insight into impending business changes and initiatives, allowing for proactive efforts to be undertaken. Leadership visibility into operations metrics showcases the role that these teams play in customer satisfaction, both internal and external, and let them better weigh choices for priorities, or ensure that operations has the time and resources to change and evolve with new business and workload initiatives.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Dedicate time to review operations metrics between stakeholders and operations teams and review report data. Place these reports in the contexts of the organizations goals and objectives to determine if they're being met. Identify sources of ambiguity where goals are not clear, or where there may be conflicts between what is asked for and what is given.

Identify where time, people, and tools can aid in operations outcomes. Determine which KPIs this would impact and what targets for success should be. Revisit regularly to ensure operations is resourced sufficiently to support the line of business.

## Question OPS10

# OPS 10 — How do you manage workload and operations events?

**Pillar**: Operational Excellence  
**Best Practices**: 7

---

# OPS10-BP01 Use a process for event, incident, and problem management

The ability to efficiently manage events, incidents, and problems is key to maintaining workload health and performance. It's crucial to recognize and understand the differences between these elements to develop an effective response and resolution strategy. Establishing and following a well-defined process for each aspect helps your team swiftly and effectively handle any operational challenges that arise.

**Desired outcome:** Your organization effectively manages operational events, incidents, and problems through well-documented and centrally stored processes. These processes are consistently updated to reflect changes, streamlining handling and maintaining high service reliability and workload performance.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You reactively, rather than proactively, respond to events.
- Inconsistent approaches are taken to different types of events or incidents.
- Your organization does not analyze and learn from incidents to prevent future occurrences.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Streamlined and standardized response processes.
- Reduced impact of incidents on services and customers.
- Expedited issue resolution.
- Continuous improvement in operational processes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means you are tracking workload events. You have processes
to handle incidents and problems. The processes are documented, shared, and updated
frequently. Problems are identified, prioritized, and fixed.

**Understanding events, incidents, and problems**

- **Events:** An *event* is an observation of an action, occurrence, or change of state. Events can be planned or unplanned and they can originate internally or externally to the workload.
- **Incidents:** *Incidents* are events that require a response, like unplanned interruptions or degradations of service quality. They represent disruptions that need immediate attention to restore normal workload operation.
- **Problems:** *Problems* are the underlying causes of one or more incidents. Identifying and resolving problems involves digging deeper into the incidents to prevent future occurrences.

### Implementation steps

**Events**

- **Monitor events:**

[Implement observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/implement-observability.html) and [utilize workload observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/utilizing-workload-observability.html).
- Monitor actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/).
- Respond to operational changes in your applications in real time with [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/).
- Continually assess, monitor, and record resource configuration changes with [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/).

- **Create processes:**

Develop a process to assess which events are significant and require monitoring. This involves setting thresholds and parameters for normal and abnormal activities.
- Determine criteria escalating an event to an incident. This could be based on the severity, impact on users, or deviation from expected behavior.
- Regularly review the event monitoring and response processes. This includes analyzing past incidents, adjusting thresholds, and refining alerting mechanisms.

**Incidents**

- **Respond to incidents:**

# OPS10-BP02 Have a process per alert

Establishing a clear and defined process for each alert in your system is essential for effective and efficient incident management. This practice ensures that every alert leads to a specific, actionable response, improving the reliability and responsiveness of your operations.

**Desired outcome:** Every alert initiates a specific, well-defined response plan. Where possible, responses are automated, with clear ownership and a defined escalation path. Alerts are linked to an up-to-date knowledge base so that any operator can respond consistently and effectively. Responses are quick and uniform across the board, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Alerts have no predefined response process, leading to makeshift and delayed resolutions.
- Alert overload causes important alerts to be overlooked.
- Alerts are inconsistently handled due to lack of clear ownership and responsibility.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduced alert fatigue by only raising actionable alerts.
- Decreased mean time to resolution (MTTR) for operational issues.
- Decreased mean time to investigate (MTTI), which helps reduce MTTR.
- Enhanced ability to scale operational responses.
- Improved consistency and reliability in handling operational events.

For example, you have a defined process for AWS Health events for critical accounts, including application alarms, operational issues, and planned lifecycle events (like updating Amazon EKS versions before clusters are auto-updated), and you provide the capability for your teams to actively monitor, communicate, and respond to these events. These actions help you prevent service disruptions caused by AWS-side changes or mitigate them faster when unexpected issues occur.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Having a process per alert involves establishing a clear response plan for each alert, automating responses where possible, and continually refining these processes based on operational feedback and evolving requirements.

### Implementation steps

The following diagram illustrates the incident management workflow within [AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/incident-manager/). It is designed to respond swiftly to operational issues by automatically creating incidents in response to specific events from [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) or [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). When an incident is created, either automatically or manually, Incident Manager centralizes the management of the incident, organizes relevant AWS resource information, and initiates predefined response plans. This includes running Systems Manager Automation runbooks for immediate action, as well as creating a parent operational work item in OpsCenter to track related tasks and analyses. This streamlined process speeds up and coordinates incident response across your AWS environment.

- **Use composite alarms:** Create [composite alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html) in CloudWatch to group related alarms, reducing noise and allowing for more meaningful responses.
- **Stay informed with [AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html):** AWS Health is the authoritative source of information about the health of your AWS Cloud resources. Use AWS Health to visualize and get notified of any current service events and upcoming changes, such as planned lifecycle events, so you can take steps to mitigate impacts.

[Create purpose-fit AWS Health event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/user-notifications.html) to e-mail and chat channels through [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html), and integrate programatically with [your monitoring and alerting tools through Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html) or the [AWS Health API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
- Plan and track progress on health events that require action by integrating with change management or ITSM tools (like [Jira](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/smc/latest/ag/cloud-sys-health.html) or [ServiceNow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/smc/latest/ag/sn-aws-health.html)) that you may already use through Amazon EventBridge or the AWS Health API.
- If you use AWS Organizations, enable
[organization view for
AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html) to aggregate AWS Health events across accounts.

- **Integrate Amazon CloudWatch alarms with Incident Manager:** Configure CloudWatch alarms to automatically create incidents in [AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/response-plans.html).
- **Integrate Amazon EventBridge with Incident Manager:** Create [EventBridge rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.html) to react to events and create incidents using defined response plans.
- **Prepare for incidents in Incident Manager:**

Establish detailed [response plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/response-plans.html) in Incident Manager for each type of alert.
- Establish chat channels through [Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/chat.html) connected to response plans in Incident Manager, facilitating real-time communication during incidents across platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Amazon Chime.
- Incorporate [Systems Manager Automation runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/runbooks.html) within Incident Manager to drive automated responses to incidents.

# OPS10-BP03 Prioritize operational events based on business impact

Responding promptly to operational events is critical, but not all events are equal. When you prioritize based on business impact, you also prioritize addressing events with the potential for significant consequences, such as safety, financial loss, regulatory violations, or damage to reputation.

**Desired outcome:** Responses to operational events are prioritized based on potential impact to business operations and objectives. This makes the responses efficient and effective.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Every event is treated with the same level of urgency, leading to confusion and delays in addressing critical issues.
- You fail to distinguish between high and low impact events, leading to misallocation of resources.
- Your organization lacks a clear prioritization framework, resulting in inconsistent responses to operational events.
- Events are prioritized based on the order they are reported, rather than their impact on business outcomes.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Ensures critical business functions receive attention first, minimizing potential damage.
- Improves resource allocation during multiple concurrent events.
- Enhances the organization's ability to maintain trust and meet regulatory requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

When faced with multiple operational events, a structured approach to prioritization based on impact and urgency is essential. This approach helps you make informed decisions, direct efforts where they're needed most, and mitigate the risk to business continuity.

### Implementation steps

- **Assess impact:** Develop a classification system to evaluate the severity of events in terms of their potential impact on business operations and objectives. The following example shows impact categories:

Impact level
Description

High

Affects many staff or customers, high financial impact, high reputational damage, or injury.

Medium

Affects a groups of staff or customers, moderate financial impact, or moderate reputational damage.

Low

Affects individual staff or customers, low financial impact, or low reputational damage.
- **Assess urgency:** Define urgency levels for how quickly an event needs a response, considering factors such as safety, financial implications, and service-level agreements (SLAs). The following example demonstrates urgency categories:

Urgency level
Description

High

Exponentially increasing damage, time-sensitive work impacted, imminent escalation, or VIP users or groups affected.

Medium

Damage increases over time, or single VIP user or group affected.

Low

Marginal damage increase over time, or non-time-sensitive work impacted.
- **Create a prioritization matrix:**

Use a matrix to cross-reference impact and urgency, assigning priority levels to different combinations.
- Make the matrix accessible and understood by all team members responsible for operational event responses.
- The following example matrix displays incident severity according to urgency and impact:

Urgency and impact
High
Medium
Low

High

Critical

Urgent

High

Medium

Urgent

High

Normal

Low

High

Normal

Low

- **Train and communicate:** Train response teams on the prioritization matrix and the importance of following it during an event. Communicate the prioritization process to all stakeholders to set clear expectations.
- **Integrate with incident response:**

Incorporate the prioritization matrix into your incident response plans and tools.
- Automate the classification and prioritization of events where possible to speed up response times.
- Enterprise Support customers can leverage [AWS Incident Detection and Response](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-incident-detection-response/), which provides 24x7 proactive monitoring and incident management for production workloads.

- **Review and adapt:** Regularly review the effectiveness of the prioritization process and make adjustments based on feedback and changes in the business environment.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Lack of clarity on recovery procedures leads to makeshift responses during critical incidents.
- Absence of defined permissions and ownership results in delays when urgent action is needed.
- Stakeholders and customers are not informed in line with expectations.
- Important decisions are delayed.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Streamlined incident response through predefined escalation procedures.
- Reduced downtime with pre-approved actions and clear ownership.
- Improved resource allocation and support-level adjustments according to incident severity.
- Improved communication to stakeholders and customers.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Properly defined escalation paths are crucial for rapid incident response. AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager supports the setup of structured escalation plans and on-call schedules, which alert the right personnel so that they are ready to act when incidents occur.

### Implementation steps

- **Set up escalation prompts:** Set up [CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-actions) to create an incident in [AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html).

is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Incorporate automation to create efficient operational workflows and minimize manual interventions.

### Implementation steps

- **Identify automation opportunites:** Determine repetitive tasks for automation, such as issue remediation, ticket enrichment, capacity management, scaling, deployments, and testing.
- **Identify automation prompts:**

Assess and define specific conditions or metrics that initiate automated responses using [Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-actions).
- Use [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) to respond to events in AWS services, custom workloads, and SaaS applications.
- Consider initiation events such as [specific log entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html), [performance metrics thresholds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html), or [state changes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/remediation.html) in AWS resources.

- **Implement event-driven automation:**

Use AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks to simplify maintenance, deployment, and remediation tasks.
- [Creating incidents in Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html) automatically gathers and adds details about the involved AWS resources to the incident.
- Proactively monitor quotas using [Quota Monitor for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/quota-monitor/).
- Automatically adjust capacity with [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) to maintain availability and performance.
- Automate development pipelines with [Amazon CodeCatalyst](https://codecatalyst.aws/explore).

is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Frequently conduct an architectural review of your workload. Use
internal and external best practices, evaluate your workload, and
identify improvement opportunities. Prioritize improvement
opportunities into your software development cadence.

### Implementation steps

- Conduct periodic architecture reviews of your production
workload with an agreed-upon frequency. Use a documented
architectural standard that includes AWS-specific best
practices.

Use your internally-defined standards for these reviews.
If you do not have an internal standard, use the AWS
Well-Architected Framework.
- Use the AWS Well-Architected Tool to create a custom
lens of your internal best practices and conduct your
architecture review.
- Contact your AWS Solution Architect or Technical Account
Manager to conduct a guided Well-Architected Framework

# OPS11-BP02 Perform post-incident analysis

Review customer-impacting events and identify the contributing
factors and preventative actions. Use this information to develop
mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence. Develop procedures for
prompt and effective responses. Communicate contributing factors and
corrective actions as appropriate, tailored to target audiences.

**Desired outcome:**

- You have established incident management processes that include
post-incident analysis.
- You have observability plans in place to collect data on events.
- With this data, you understand and collect metrics that support
your post-incident analysis process.
- You learn from incidents to improve future outcomes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You administer an application server. Approximately every 23
hours and 55 minutes all your active sessions are terminated.
You have tried to identify what is going wrong on your
application server. You suspect it could instead be a network
issue but are unable to get cooperation from the network team as
they are too busy to support you. You lack a predefined process
to follow to get support and collect the information necessary
to determine what is going on.
- You have had data loss within your workload. This is the first
time it has happened and the cause is not obvious. You decide it
is not important because you can recreate the data. Data loss
starts occurring with greater frequency impacting your
customers. This also places addition operational burden on you
as you restore the missing data.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- You have a predefined process to determine the components,
conditions, actions, and events that contributed to an incident,
which helps you identify opportunities for improvement.
- You use data from post-incident analysis to make improvements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Use a process to determine contributing factors. Review all
customer impacting incidents. Have a process to identify and
document the contributing factors of an incident so that you can
develop mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence and you can
develop procedures for prompt and effective responses. Communicate
incident root causes as appropriate, and tailor the communication
to your target audience. Share learnings openly within your
organization.

### Implementation steps

- Collect metrics such as deployment change, configuration
change, incident start time, alarm time, time of engagement,
mitigation start time, and incident resolved time.
- Describe key time points on the timeline to understand the
events of the incident.
- Ask the following questions:

Could you improve time to detection?
- Are there updates to metrics and alarms that would
detect the incident sooner?
- Can you improve the time to diagnosis?
- Are there updates to your response plans or escalation
plans that would engage the correct responders sooner?
- Can you improve the time to mitigation?
- Are there runbook or playbook steps that you could add
or improve?
- Can you prevent future incidents from occurring?

- Create checklists and actions. Track and deliver all
actions.

**Level of effort for the implementation
plan:** Medium

# OPS11-BP03 Implement feedback loops

Feedback loops provide actionable insights that drive decision making.
Build feedback loops into your procedures and workloads. This helps you
identify issues and areas that need improvement. They also validate investments
made in improvements. These feedback loops are the foundation for continuously
improving your workload.

Feedback loops fall into two categories: *immediate feedback* and *retrospective analysis*.
Immediate feedback is gathered through review of the performance and outcomes from operations
activities. This feedback comes from team members, customers, or the automated output of
the activity. Immediate feedback is received from things like A/B testing and shipping new
features, and it is essential to failing fast.

Retrospective analysis is performed regularly to capture feedback from the review of
operational outcomes and metrics over time. These retrospectives happen at the end of
a sprint, on a cadence, or after major releases or events. This type of feedback loop
validates investments in operations or your workload. It helps you measure success and
validates your strategy.

**Desired outcome:** You use immediate feedback and retrospective
analysis to drive improvements. There is a mechanism to capture user and team member feedback.
Retrospective analysis is used to identify trends that drive improvements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You launch a new feature but have no way of receiving customer feedback on it.
- After investing in operations improvements, you don’t conduct a retrospective to validate them.
- You collect customer feedback but don’t regularly review it.
- Feedback loops lead to proposed action items but they aren’t included in the software development process.
- Customers don’t receive feedback on improvements they’ve proposed.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- You can work backwards from the customer to drive new features.
- Your organization culture can react to changes faster.
- Trends are used to identify improvement opportunities.
- Retrospectives validate investments made to your workload and operations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means that you use both immediate feedback and retrospective analysis.
These feedback loops drive improvements. There are many mechanisms for immediate feedback, including
surveys, customer polls, or feedback forms. Your organization also uses retrospectives to identify
improvement opportunities and validate initiatives.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail created a web form where customers can give feedback or report issues. During the weekly
scrum, user feedback is evaluated by the software development team. Feedback is regularly used to steer the
evolution of their platform. They conduct a retrospective at the end of each sprint to identify items they
want to improve.

## Implementation steps

- Immediate feedback

You need a mechanism to receive feedback from customers and team members.
Your operations activities can also be configured to deliver automated feedback.
- Your organization needs a process to review this feedback, determine what to
improve, and schedule the improvement.
- Feedback must be added into your software development process.
- As you make improvements, follow up with the feedback submitter.

You can use [AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html) to create and track these improvements as [OpsItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-working-with-OpsItems.html).

- Retrospective analysis

Conduct retrospectives at the end of a development cycle, on a set cadence, or after a major release.
- Gather stakeholders involved in the workload for a retrospective meeting.
- Create three columns on a whiteboard or spreadsheet: Stop, Start, and Keep.

*Stop* is for anything that you want your team to
stop doing.
- *Start* is for ideas that you want to start
doing.
- *Keep* is for items that you want to keep doing.

- Go around the room and gather feedback from the stakeholders.
- Prioritize the feedback. Assign actions and stakeholders to any Start or Keep items.
- Add the actions to your software development process and communicate status updates to
stakeholders as you make the improvements.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. To implement this
best practice, you need a way to take in immediate feedback and analyze it. Also, you need to
establish a retrospective analysis process.

# OPS11-BP04 Perform knowledge management

Knowledge management helps team members find the information to perform their job. In learning organizations, information is freely shared which empowers individuals. The information can be discovered or searched. Information is accurate and up to date. Mechanisms exist to create new information, update existing information, and archive outdated information. The most common example of a knowledge management platform is a content management system like a wiki.

**Desired outcome:**

- Team members have access to timely, accurate information.
- Information is searchable.
- Mechanisms exist to add, update, and archive information.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- There is no centralized knowledge storage. Team members manage their own notes on their local machines.
- You have a self-hosted wiki but no mechanisms to manage information, resulting in outdated information.
- Someone identifies missing information but there’s no process to request adding it the team wiki. They add it themselves but they miss a key step, leading to an outage.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Team members are empowered because information is shared freely.
- New team members are onboarded faster because documentation is up to date and searchable.
- Information is timely, accurate, and actionable.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Knowledge management is an important facet of learning organizations. To begin, you need a central repository to store your knowledge (as a common example, a self-hosted wiki). You must develop processes for adding, updating, and archiving knowledge. Develop standards for what should be documented and let everyone contribute.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Retail hosts an internal Wiki where all knowledge is stored. Team members are encouraged to add to the knowledge base as they go about their daily duties. On a quarterly basis, a cross-functional team evaluates which pages are least updated and determines if they should be archived or updated.

**Implementation steps**

- Start with identifying the content management system where knowledge will be stored. Get agreement from stakeholders across your organization.

If you don’t have an existing content management system, consider running a self-hosted wiki or using a version control repository as a starting point.

- Develop runbooks for adding, updating, and archiving information. Educate your team on these processes.
- Identify what knowledge should be stored in the content management system. Start with daily activities (runbooks and playbooks) that team members perform. Work with stakeholders to prioritize what knowledge is added.
- On a periodic basis, work with stakeholders to identify out-of-date information and archive it or bring it up to date.

**Level of effort for the implementation plan:** Medium. If you don’t have an existing content management system, you can set up a self-hosted wiki or a version-controlled document repository.

# OPS11-BP05 Define drivers for improvement

Identify drivers for improvement to help you evaluate and prioritize
opportunities based on data and feedback loops. Explore improvement
opportunities in your systems and processes, and automate where
appropriate.

**Desired outcome:**

- You track data from across your environment.
- You correlate events and activities to business outcomes.
- You can compare and contrast between environments and systems.
- You maintain a detailed activity history of your deployments and
outcomes.
- You collect data to support your security posture.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You collect data from across your environment but do not
correlate events and activities.
- You collect detailed data from across your estate, and it drives
high Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail activity and cost.
However, you do not use this data meaningfully.
- You do not account for business outcomes when defining drivers
for improvement.
- You do not measure the effects of new features.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- You minimize the impact of event-based motivations or emotional
investment by determining criteria for improvement.
- You respond to business events, not just technical ones.
- You measure your environment to identify areas of improvement.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- Understand drivers for improvement: You should only make
changes to a system when a desired outcome is supported.

Desired capabilities: Evaluate desired features and
capabilities when evaluating opportunities for
improvement.

# OPS11-BP06 Validate insights

Review your analysis results and responses with cross-functional
teams and business owners. Use these reviews to establish common
understanding, identify additional impacts, and determine courses of
action. Adjust responses as appropriate.

**Desired outcomes:**

- You review insights with business owners on a regular basis.
Business owners provide additional context to newly-gained
insights.
- You review insights and request feedback from technical peers,
and you share your learnings across teams.
- You publish data and insights for other technical and business
teams to review. You factor in your learnings to new practices
by other departments.
- Summarize and review new insights with senior leaders. Senior
leaders use new insights to define strategy.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You release a new feature. This feature changes some of your
customer behaviors. Your observability does not take these
changes into account. You do not quantify the benefits of these
changes.
- You push a new update and neglect refreshing your CDN. The CDN
cache is no longer compatible with the latest release. You
measure the percentage of requests with errors. All of your
users report HTTP 400 errors when communicating with backend
servers. You investigate the client errors and find that because
you measured the wrong dimension, your time was wasted.
- Your service-level agreement stipulates 99.9% uptime, and your
recovery point objective is four hours. The service owner maintains
that the system is zero downtime. You implement an expensive and
complex replication solution, which wastes time and money.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- When you validate insights with business owners and
subject matter experts, you establish common understanding and more
effectively guide improvement.
- You discover hidden issues and factor them into future
decisions.
- Your focus moves from technical outcomes to business outcomes.

# OPS11-BP07 Perform operations metrics reviews

Regularly perform retrospective analysis of operations metrics with
cross-team participants from different areas of the business. Use
these reviews to identify opportunities for improvement, potential
courses of action, and to share lessons learned. Look for
opportunities to improve in all of your environments (for example,
development, test, and production).

**Desired outcome:**

- You frequently review business-affecting metrics
- You detect and review anomalies through your observability
capabilities
- You use data to support business outcomes and goals

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your maintenance window interrupts a significant retail
promotion. The business remains unaware that there is a standard
maintenance window that could be delayed if there are other
business impacting events.
- You suffered an extended outage because you commonly use an
outdated library in your organization. You have since migrated
to a supported library. The other teams in your organization do
not know that they are at risk.
- You do not regularly review attainment of customer SLAs. You are
trending to not meet your customer SLAs. There are financial
penalties related to not meeting your customer SLAs.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- When you meet regularly to review operations metrics, events,
and incidents, you maintain common understanding across teams.
- Your team meets routinely to review metrics and incidents, which
positions you to take action on risks and recognize customer
SLAs.
- You share lessons learned, which provides data for
prioritization and targeted improvements for business outcomes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

- Regularly perform retrospective analysis of operations metrics
with cross-team participants from different areas of the
business.
- Engage stakeholders, including the business, development, and
operations teams, to validate your findings from immediate
feedback and retrospective analysis and share lessons learned.
- Use their insights to identify opportunities for improvement
and potential courses of action.

# OPS11-BP08 Document and share lessons learned

Document and share lessons learned from the operations activities so
that you can use them internally and across teams. You should share
what your teams learn to increase the benefit across your
organization. Share information and resources to prevent avoidable
errors and ease development efforts, and focus on delivery of
desired features.

Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define permissions
that permit controlled access to the resources you wish to share
within and across accounts.

**Desired outcome:**

- You use version-controlled repositories to share application
libraries, scripted procedures, procedure documentation, and
other system documentation.
- You share your infrastructure standards as version-controlled
AWS CloudFormation templates.
- You review lessons learned across teams.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You suffered an extended outage because your organization
commonly uses buggy library. You have since migrated to a
reliable library. The other teams in your organization do not
know they are at risk. No one documents and shares the
experience with this library, and they are not aware of the
risk.
- You have identified an edge case in an internally-shared
microservice that causes sessions to drop. You have updated your
calls to the service to avoid this edge case. The other teams in
your organization do not know that they are at risk.
- You have found a way to significantly reduce the CPU utilization
requirements for one of your microservices. You do not know if
any other teams could take advantage of this technique.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Share lessons learned to support improvement
and to maximize the benefits of experience.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

- **Document and share lessons learned:** Have procedures to
document the lessons learned from the running of operations
activities and retrospective analysis so that they can be used
by other teams.
- **Share learnings:** Have procedures to share lessons learned and
associated artifacts across teams. For example, share updated
procedures, guidance, governance, and best practices through
an accessible wiki. Share scripts, code, and libraries through
a common repository.

Leverage [AWS re:Post Private](https://aws.amazon.com/repost-private/) as a knowledge service to streamline collaboration and knowledge sharing within your organization.

# OPS11-BP09 Allocate time to make improvements

Dedicate time and resources within your processes to make continuous
incremental improvements possible.

**Desired outcome:**

- You create temporary duplicates of environments, which lowers
the risk, effort, and cost of experimentation and testing.
- These duplicated environments can be used to test the
conclusions from your analysis, experiment, and develop and test
planned improvements.
- You run gamedays, and you use Fault Injection Service (FIS) to
provide the controls and guardrails that teams need to run
experiments in a production-like environment.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- There is a known performance issue in your application server.
It is added to the backlog behind every planned feature
implementation. If the rate of planned features being added
remains constant, the performance issue would never be
addressed.
- To support continual improvement, you approve administrators and
developers using all their extra time to select and implement
improvements. No improvements are ever completed.
- Operational acceptance is complete, and you do not test
operational practices again.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By dedicating time and resources within your
processes, you can make continuous, incremental improvements
possible.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

- Allocate time to make improvements: Dedicate time and
resources within your processes to make continuous,
incremental improvements.
- Implement changes to improve and evaluate the results to
determine success.
- If the results do not satisfy the goals and the improvement is
still a priority, pursue alternative courses of action.
- Simulate production workloads through game days, and use
learnings from these simulations to improve.
