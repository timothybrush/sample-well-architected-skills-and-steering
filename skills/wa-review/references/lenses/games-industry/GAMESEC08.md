# GAMESEC08-BP01 Apply security at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline

Guardrails such as access controls, separation of duties, and
audit trails provide protection against unauthorized access or
malicious activities.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Your people, processes, and technology
should secure the pipeline as well. The people closest to the code
must establish secure coding practices and make sure they follow
them. Iterate on your processes continuously to verify that there
is consistency in the level of security throughout the pipeline.
Lastly, implement technology to verify that best practices and
processes are not bypassed.

**Customer example**

AnyCompany Games implements role-based access controls in which
only senior developers can approve changes to their anti-cheat
system code, while requiring mandatory code reviews from security
team members for components that handle player payment data.

Their CI/CD pipeline automatically runs threat model validation
checks, making sure that new features like a player trading
marketplace are tested against previously identified attack
vectors such as item duplication exploits or fraudulent
transaction attempts.

### Implementation steps

- Provide users permissions bases on the principle of least
privilege.
- Use AWS CloudTrail to audit API calls made across the
services used in the pipeline.
- Employ pre-commit hooks to verify that code is following
general practices and company policies.
