# [DL.LD.7] Establish sandbox environments with spend limits

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Sandbox environments are dedicated spaces for developers to
explore, experiment, and innovate with new technologies or
ideas. Unlike development environments, which are meant for
more structured day-to-day development, they allow more fewer controls, while ensuring no connectivity to
internal networks or other environments.

Create a comprehensive sandbox usage policy. This policy must
set clear boundaries on the kinds of data permissible with the
sandbox, ensuring no leakage of sensitive information or
code. Establish rules for access controls. Some environments
might be tailored for individual developers, while others
could serve small teams. Rules regarding network connectivity
should ensure that the sandbox remains isolated, preventing
any unintended interactions with other internal networks or
environments. Set tagging strategies which can aid in managing
automation and cost tracking. Overall, ensure that this policy
makes a distinction between sandbox environments and
development environments, and lays out the use cases best
suited for each.

Educate developers on the sandbox usage policy, including
responsible and cost-effective resource management techniques.
Encourage shutting down or deleting unnecessary resources,
especially when they're not in active use. Sandbox
environments should be treated ephemerally, with automated
governance processes managing the lifecycle to create, manage,
clean up resources, and destroy sandbox environments as
required.
