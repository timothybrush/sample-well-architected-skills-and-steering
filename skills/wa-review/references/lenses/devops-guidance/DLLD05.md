# [DL.LD.5] Enforce coding standards before commit

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Identify common style, formatting, and other flaws before they
are published to a repository. Use static code scanning tools,
such as linters, to improve code quality and consistency
before pushing committed code. This process can be automated
using pre-commit hooks. Upon discovery, pushing the commit
should ideally fail and require immediate correction by the
developer. Automatically and consistently enforcing coding
standards during the local development process directly
improves the code review process by removing common errors
before manual review.

Select scanning tools compatible with your chosen programming
language and customize them to uphold specific coding
standards and styles. It is best to integrate these tools into
pre-commit hooks, integrated development environments (IDEs),
and continuous integration pipelines so that changes are
consistently and continuously checked at all stages of the
development lifecycle.
