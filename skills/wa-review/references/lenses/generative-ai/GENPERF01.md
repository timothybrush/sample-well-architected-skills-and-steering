curated for generative AI workloads. Ground truth data is a
curated set of prompts and responses that describe the ideal
workflow with a model.

**Desired outcome:** When
implemented, this best practice enables the measurement of a
model's performance for a set of tasks, accelerating model
evaluation and enabling model customization workflows.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

## Implementation guidance

*Ground truth data*, also known as a
*golden dataset*, is data considered to be
of the highest quality in regard to a specific use case.
Ground truth data for generative AI workloads are oftentimes
prompt-response pairs. For a simple workflow, a golden dataset
might be dozens, hundreds, thousands or more sample prompts
and their corresponding expected responses. There may be
several prompts containing variations of the same ask, with
several responses describing variations of an acceptable
response. More complex workflows like retrieval augmented
generation or agentic workflows may require variations on this
paradigm.

Ground truth data is vital for the efficient testing of
data-driven and generative AI workloads. Develop ground truth
data for your generative AI applications to facilitate the
rigorous and uniform testing of large language models. When
equipped with a ground truth dataset for a use case, you can
automate the testing and evaluation of models. New models can
quickly be evaluated to determine if their performance for a
specific use case meets the current model's high bar.

Ground truth prompts should be clear and succinct, grouped
together by variations of the same ask. Ground truth responses
should similarly be clear and succinct, covering a range of
acceptable responses. When developing a ground truth data set,
don't be overly concerned with slight differences in prompts
that essentially ask a model to perform the same task. Prompts
in the ground truth data set should be specific to the kinds
of tasks you expect a model to solve. Consider ground truth
data as a living artifact, one that changes and extends based
on the use cases being tested and the usage paradigms being
implemented.

Prompt-responses pairs are the core of a ground truth dataset,
but ground truth data needs additional meta-data to be viable
for the extent of generative AI usage paradigms that could be
tested. For example, agent workflows perform tasks on behalf
of a requester, using its judgment to discern how to interpret
a response from an external system. An agent workflow may
synthesize several intermediary responses before the language
model delivers a final response to the user. Ground truth data
should be able to capture an ideal prompt flow, tracing the
workflow of the agent through various systems. This same
practice could be applied to workflows interacting with
multiple models.

Develop ground truth data in accordance with your
organization's AI policy. For example, if your organization's
AI policy prohibits testing models against production data,
your golden dataset should contain references to data which is
functionally equivalent to production data. Develop mock data
sets for testing, and mock endpoints for testing agentic
flows. The golden dataset should contain the instructions
required for a testing harness to run tests autonomously
against any model endpoint available, including self-hosted
language models.

In addition to facilitating rapid model testing and
evaluation, golden datasets can be used to quickly fine-tune
models or distill student models from teacher models. Model
customization workflows require high-quality data for
customization. Maintaining a robust golden dataset for each
use case can accelerate your ability to customize models.

### Implementation steps

- Define a series of prompts and their expected responses.

Consider using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth or similar
to scale the curation of this dataset.
- Enrich prompt-response pairs with relevant meta-data in
accordance with your organization's AI policy.

- Store the data in a way which facilitates a
dictionary-style lookup of the data.

The first several layers could be organizational,
referring to abstractions like language, business
domain, or use case.
- The last layer includes the prompt-response pairs, where
the prompt is the key and the expected response is the
value.
- Store the data in an object-store such as Amazon S3.

- Create a data dictionary to facilitate access to the
ground truth data.

Crawl the object-store using an AWS Glue Crawler to
build the data dictionary.

- Develop a testing harness that can automatically test
models as they are made available using the ground truth
data.

Query segments of the ground-truth dataset using a
federated query solution such as Amazon Athena.
- Incorporate mock production data and tooling for more
advanced workflows such as agents or RAG.

- Define test scenarios corresponding to your golden
dataset and adhere to your organization's AI policy.

Define metrics to test models against as may be required
by your organization's AI policy.
- Track model performance across various tests and
metrics, carefully evaluating the trade-offs across
models.

# GENPERF01-BP02 Collect performance metrics from generative AI workloads

Foundation model performance on specific tasks is measured and
quantified in different ways depending on the desired outcome.
It is important to discern the performance of a model over time
when selecting foundation models for generative AI workloads by
identifying performance metrics and evaluating model
performance. This is true not just for model inference, but
model training and customization workloads as well.

**Desired outcome:** When
implemented, your organization improves its ability to evaluate
model performance against the identified performance metric.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**
[Experiment
more often](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-dp.html) - Testing model performance using quantifiable
evaluation metrics assists in the selection of foundation models
for generative AI workloads.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Traditional performance monitoring and optimization focus on
the efficiency of compute, network, memory and storage
resources. Generative AI workloads add new dimensions to the
performance considerations, particularly concerning response
quality. Inaccurate model responses or models responding in an
overly casual, dismissive, or even toxic manner may be
considered under-performing. Consult your organization's AI
policy for more details on what constitutes an
under-performing language model with respect to your use case.

Different use cases may have several relevant metrics for use
in evaluating model performance. Performance metrics for
inference workloads may capture model response latency or
throughput. Performance metrics for model customization or
training workloads are likely focused on model training times.
Ultimately, a model should respond with accurately, robustly,
and somewhat predictably. Capturing model performance against
these metrics and evaluating model performance against your
organization's AI performance requirements helps to provide
consistently high performing generative AI workloads.

Generative AI tasks should report metrics, telemetry and logs
to a centralized logging and monitoring solution such as
Amazon CloudWatch. By configuring Amazon CloudWatch or
similar, customers can collect performance metrics from model
endpoints hosted in Amazon SageMaker AI or generative AI
services like Amazon Q for Amazon Bedrock. These metrics can
be used to identify which models perform well against a
metric, and which need additional performance improvements.

Performance metrics may also be collected by applications and
services that interact with models. Collect metrics and
application traces pertaining to the flow of information
rather than a specific piece of the workflow. Work to
determine how your entire application performs when
interacting with generative AI solutions. This can help you
triage performance concerns faster and improve resolution
times.

Use internal golden datasets or external benchmarking datasets
to evaluate model performance on specific tasks. Consult model
cards to identify model strengths and weaknesses, evaluating
on selected datasets where appropriate. Benchmark custom
models on a suite of tests using internal and external data to
develop a well-rounded understanding of your model's
performance.

Note that a model may not excel at all tasks. Be judicious
when selecting a performance metric for your model, and
consult your organization's AI policy to identify which
performance metric to prioritize for your use case.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the performance metrics to prioritize for your
generative AI use case.
- Develop a mechanism to capture the performance metrics.

- Implement a trace framework like
[OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry)
to capture additional metrics.
- Capture metrics using Amazon CloudWatch or a similar
centralized logging and monitoring solution.
- Use a benchmarking dataset within an evaluation
framework such as
[fmeval](https://github.com/aws/fmeval).

- Establish reasonable performance thresholds and alert
accordingly.

- Use Amazon CloudWatch alarms for production alerting on
latency, throughput, or other traditional performance
metrics.
- Incorporate regular benchmarking using internal golden
datasets, and update the dataset as your customer's
usage changes.
- Consult model cards for new models, and perform custom
benchmarking of new models where appropriate.

- Identify, capture, and log remediation actions in your
organization's AI policy.

- For example, increased latency on self-hosted models may
call for horizontal scaling to remediate the issue. Your
organization's AI policy should define acceptable
latency thresholds.
- For example, a model response which is identified as a
hallucination may call for updates to a system prompt.
Such an update should require testing against internal
golden datasets to verify that system prompt changes do
not adversely affect related prompt workflows.

- Implement a centralized experiment tracking solution
such as Amazon SageMaker AI with MLflow.
