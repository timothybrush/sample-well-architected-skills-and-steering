# HNCOST08-BP01 Regular cost analysis

Review cost dashboards to identify underutilized resources,
anomalous spikes, and opportunities to switch connectivity types.

**Desired outcome:** Data-driven cost
reduction through continuous refinement.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Visibility into cost drivers
- Identification of legacy resources for decommissioning
- Support for budget forecasting

## Implementation guidance

- Identified data transfer changes in cost data, such as by
filtering Cost and Usage data by line_item_usage_type for
DataTransfer-Out-Bytes.
- Use cost dashboards to review usage patterns. For example, you
can achieve this by using Amazon Athena and Amazon Quick
Suite.
- Share findings in regular, weekly or monthly and FinOps
reviews.
