# HNCOST07-BP01 Use dedicated connection for high-volume predictable traffic

Deploy dedicated connection for production workloads requiring
consistent, high-bandwidth connectivity between on-premises and
cloud environments. Dedicated connection offers lower per-GB costs
compared to IPSec VPN and avoids internet variability.

**Desired outcome:** Predictable,
reduced data transfer costs for mission-critical workloads.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- cost savings versus VPN for high-volume traffic
- Improved performance and reliability

## Implementation guidance

- Start with low bandwidth dedicated connections and scale up
with high bandwidth connections or multiple connections with
LAG
