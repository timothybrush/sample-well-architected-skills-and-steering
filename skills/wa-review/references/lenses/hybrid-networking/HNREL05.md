# HNREL05-BP01 Failover testing of dedicated connections

Regular failover testing of dedicated connections is essential for
ensuring the resilience and reliability of hybrid network
environments. Simulating various scenarios by temporarily disabling
BGP peering sessions between on-premises networks and cloud. By
regularly exercising these tests, organizations can validate their
recovery procedures, uncover latent bugs, and ensure their hybrid
network architecture performs as expected during failover scenarios.

**Desired outcome:** Verify that
failover and recovery procedures for Direct Connect connections work
as intended, minimizing downtime during real incidents.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Uncovers misconfigurations or gaps in failover processes
- Increases confidence in your recovery plans
- Enables you to proactively address weaknesses before actual
failures
- Reduces business impact of network outages

## Implementation guidance

- Simulated BGP failures of dedicated connections and observe
failover behavior, using services such as the AWS Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit.
- Test all redundant dedicated connections and VPN links to
ensure expected failover behavior.
- Document and refine your recovery steps based on test
outcomes.
- Repeat testing regularly and after significant changes.
