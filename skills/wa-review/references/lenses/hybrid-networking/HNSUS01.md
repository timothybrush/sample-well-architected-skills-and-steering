# HNSUS01-BP01 Decommission unused assets and consolidate redundant resources

Regularly audit your workload to identify and remove unused or
redundant assets (for example, orphaned storage volumes, inactive
EC2 instances, and outdated datasets). Consolidate overlapping
resources (for example, duplicate reports and redundant databases)
to eliminate waste.

**Desired outcome:** Reduced resource
consumption and minimized environmental footprint by eliminating
unnecessary infrastructure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Frees up compute, storage, and network resources
- Lowers energy consumption and costs
- Simplifies architecture and improves maintainability

## Implementation guidance

- Identify underutilized resources. For example, you can achieve
this using AWS Trusted Advisor Cost Optimization Checks
- Use policies to automate deletion of unused assets. For
example, you can achieve this using Amazon S3 Lifecycle
Policies and Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager
