# EUCSEC14-BP01 Encrypt disk volumes to protect data at rest

Protect security, integrity, and availability of data at rest to
make sure it is reliably accessible when needed.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Encrypt Amazon WorkSpaces Personal disk volumes. Each Amazon
WorkSpace Personal instance is provisioned with a root volume
(C: drive for Windows WorkSpaces Personal, root file system
for Amazon Linux WorkSpaces Personal) and a user volume (D:
drive for Windows WorkSpaces Personal, /home for Amazon Linux
WorkSpaces Personal). The encrypted WorkSpaces feature
encrypts one or both volumes. For WorkSpaces Personal
instances used by users (rather than for creating custom
images), it is a best practice for these to be encrypted. For
more details, see
[Encrypted
WorkSpaces in WorkSpaces Personal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/encrypt-workspaces.html).

# EUCSEC14-BP02 Encrypt data in transit in your EUC environment

Use encryption to protect data confidentiality while in transit
inside your EUC environment.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Use AWS EUC streaming protocols to encrypt streaming data in
transit. Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon WorkSpaces Applications provide
data encryption of pixel streaming traffic between instances
and end user devices by default. Evaluate the default levels
of encryption to verify that they provide sufficient
protection in terms of key length and cipher suites and
satisfy the requirements of the organization. For further
details regarding the encryption used for Amazon AppStream,
see
[Data
Protection in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/data-protection.html) , and for Amazon WorkSpaces, see

Protection in Amazon WorkSpaces.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/data-protection.html)

# EUCSEC14-BP03 Limit egress channels available to users to only the required set of channels to perform their role

End user systems can provide multiple channels for users to
export and access data. Evaluate these channels to determine
their suitability in the specific use case being delivered.
Block channels not required for specific use cases.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- **Encrypt streaming and control data
traffic using strong ciphers**: To protect data
confidentiality, WorkSpaces using PCoIP are encrypted
using an AES 128-bit cipher by default. For encryption up
to AES 256-bit see
[Data
protection in Amazon WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/data-protection.html). Evaluate your
security requirements and use stronger ciphers where
necessary. For Windows, you can implement this using the
Group Policy template, and for Linux WorkSpaces, the
appropriate configuration file needs to be edited to
increase the default level of encryption. For example, for
PCoIP Amazon Linux 2 WorkSpaces, edit the
/etc/pcoip-agent/pcoip-agent.conf file.
- WorkSpaces using the Amazon DCV protocol have streaming
and control data in-transit encrypted using DTLS 1.3
encryption for UDP traffic and TLS 1.3 encryption for TCP
traffic with AES-256 ciphers. For details of the
implementation, see
[Data
protection in Amazon WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/data-protection.html).
- **Restrict data access to required
functionality within Amazon WorkSpaces**: To
protect data on the endpoint used to connect to an Amazon WorkSpaces session and the WorkSpace itself, enable data
exportation features only when needed and allowed to
users. For example, Amazon WorkSpaces can block copying
in-session clipboard contents to the endpoint, copying of
files between client and WorkSpace, and block printers
attached to the endpoint from being mapped into the
session. The blocking of these capabilities can remove
these potential data exportation vectors from the Amazon WorkSpaces service.
- The implementation of these controls is through Group
Policy on Windows WorkSpaces, editing the
/etc/pcoip-agent/pcoip-agent.conf file on Amazon Linux 2
WorkSpaces using PCoIP, or editing the /etc/wsp/wsp.conf
file on Ubuntu Amazon WorkSpaces using Amazon DCV. For
details on how to configure clipboard and other settings
on Windows WorkSpaces, see
[Manage
your Windows WorkSpaces in WorkSpaces Personal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/group_policy.html).
- **Restrict data access to required
functionality within Amazon WorkSpaces Applications**: To
protect data on the endpoint used to connect to an Amazon
WorkSpaces Applications session and the WorkSpaces Applications instance
itself, implement controls to close potential inbound or
outbound channels that are not required by the users
connecting to the service. The service has controls to
configure the clipboard, file transfer, printing to a
local device, and file system redirection. You can
configure each of these options on an WorkSpaces Applications stack
and disable them when not required. For details on
configuring data access restrictions with Amazon AppStream
2.0, see
[Create
an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet and Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/set-up-stacks-fleets.html#set-up-stacks-fleets-install).
