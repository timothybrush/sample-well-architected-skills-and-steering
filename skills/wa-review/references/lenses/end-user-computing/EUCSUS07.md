# EUCSUS07-BP01 Identify the volume and data requirement for your user profiles

align with your business case.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

profile. It is a best practice to monitor the storage usage of
home folders, application settings persistence, or other storage
solutions like FSLogix, OneDrive, and Google Drive. With
FSLogix, enable de-duplication in FSx and VHD disk compaction.
Fsx for Windows / Fsx on tap.
