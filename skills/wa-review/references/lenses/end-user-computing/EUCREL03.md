# EUCREL03-BP01 Add redundancy to networking connections

Use a redundant networking architecture for Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications,
incorporating multiple Active Directory (AD) Controllers, AD connectors, DNS servers,
gateways, VPNs, or AWS Direct Connect links. This approach supports continuous
connectivity by providing alternative pathways for network traffic, reducing the risk of
service disruptions due to network incidents and enhancing overall system resilience.
Redundant networking helps mitigate the impact of network failures and supports
uninterrupted access to WorkSpaces environments.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:**High

## Implementation guidance

Enhance the resilience of Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications by configuring
redundant networking components such as VPN connections or AWS Direct Connect links.
This setup provides alternative paths for network traffic, mitigating the impact of
network incidents and supporting continuous access to WorkSpaces environments. Verify
that you have multiple AD controllers and connectors across multiple Availability Zones.

Additionally, regularly monitor and test the redundant networking setup to check
its effectiveness in maintaining continuous connectivity. Conduct failover tests and
simulations to validate the redundancy configuration and identify any potential areas
for improvement. By implementing redundant networking architecture, you can strengthen
the resilience of your EUC environment and reduce the risk of downtime caused by network
disruptions.
