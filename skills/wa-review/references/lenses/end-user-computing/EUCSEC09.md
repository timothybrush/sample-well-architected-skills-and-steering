# EUCSEC09-BP01 Verify that your instances are configured as expected

Unexpected configuration changes to end user systems can help
you identify possible threat actors. Users should not need to
reconfigure applications or operating systems for the daily use
of their application portfolio.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Automate configuration management tools to verify compliance.
Use centralized control and enforcement of configuration
settings applied to Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications
instances to verify that configuration settings align with the
desired configuration of instances.

- For Active Directory domain-joined Windows instances, use
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to apply a known configuration
to instances.
- For Amazon WorkSpaces Linux instances, consider
configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, and
Puppet to apply a known configuration.
- For Amazon WorkSpaces Applications On-Demand and Always-On fleets,
apply desired configuration settings to the instance used
to create the Image for the associated fleet.

After deployment, you can audit Amazon WorkSpaces Personal
instances to determine if the expected and desired
configuration of instances is in effect or whether this has
been overridden or tampered with. Configuration management
tools such as Ansible, Chef, and Puppet can help with this, as
can PowerShell Desired State Configuration.
