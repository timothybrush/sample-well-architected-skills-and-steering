# AGENTSEC05-BP01 Implement comprehensive logging and decision artifact storage

Agent decisions are only auditable if the reasoning behind them is
captured, preserved intact, and reachable at the speed
investigations actually move. Tamper-evident artifact storage,
attribution to the original trigger, and a queryable index turn raw
log volume into forensic capability.

**Desired outcome:**

- You capture every agent decision, action, and reasoning step in
tamper-evident, queryable storage, producing a complete and
verifiable record of agent behavior.
- Each logged action includes attribution to the initiating source
(a human user session, an upstream event, a schedule, or another
agent), so logged actions can typically be traced back to what
triggered them.
- You can reconstruct the full decision-making process for any
agent action from stored artifacts, independent of the agent's
own account of its reasoning.
- Cryptographic validation verifies log integrity, the agent's
operational IAM role can't modify or delete its own decision
history, and sensitive data (PII, secrets, regulated fields) is
masked or redacted before logs are written to long-term storage.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Logging only final agent outputs without intermediate reasoning,
tool invocations, or decision points, making incident
reconstruction impossible.
- Storing logs and decision artifacts in mutable storage without
write-once protection, so logs can be deleted or modified after
the fact.
- Storing decision artifacts in the same account and with the same
permissions as the agent's operational resources, letting an
affected agent modify or delete its own history.
- Retaining artifacts without a queryable index, so scanning raw
S3 objects becomes impractical during time-sensitive
investigations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Detailed logging of reasoning chains, tool invocations, and
intermediate steps, stored independently from the agent's
operational resources, supports reconstruction of agent behavior
during investigations.
- Amazon S3 Object Lock and AWS CloudTrail log file validation
provide cryptographic proof of log integrity for compliance and
forensic purposes.
- Queryable artifact stores support retrospective behavioral
analysis that surfaces patterns missed by real-time alerts.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Logging for agents has three hard requirements that ordinary
application logging doesn't:

- Completeness (the reasoning chain, not just the outputs)
- Immutability (the agent whose behavior you are investigating
can't be the entity that controls its own logs)
- Queryability at investigation speed (S3 scans are not fast
enough when minutes matter)

Each of those requirements shapes a different piece of the
architecture.

Start with the model invocation layer. Enable Amazon Bedrock model
invocation logging to capture all inference requests and responses
(input prompts, model outputs, token counts, latency metrics) with
delivery to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for operational monitoring and
Amazon S3 for long-term retention. Because agent prompts and model
outputs often contain PII, secrets, or regulated data, apply data
protection before content lands in long-term storage.
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs data protection policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html) automatically
detect and mask sensitive types (credentials, personal
identifiers, financial data) in log events.
[Amazon
Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) sensitive information filters anonymize
or redact PII in input prompts and model responses at inference
time, but that is distinct from what the logs capture. Verify
masking behavior across each destination in use (Amazon Bedrock
Model Invocation Logs, AgentCore Observability, CloudWatch Logs,
the S3 artifact store) and add write-time masking in agent code
wherever the source doesn't mask on its own.

Decision artifacts require a separate trust boundary. Create a
dedicated S3 bucket in a separate AWS account with versioning
enabled, and use bucket policies that allow write from the agent
account but deny delete and overwrite operations. That gives you
an append-only artifact store the agent's operational IAM role
can't tamper with. A consistent key schema (agent ID, session ID,
timestamp, decision type) makes retrieval predictable during
investigations. Capture the initiator on every decision. An agent
can be invoked by:

- A human user session
- An Amazon EventBridge event
- An Amazon SQS message
- An Amazon CloudWatch alarm
- A scheduled rule
- Another agent

Log the identifiers that describe the trigger (IAM session or
Amazon Cognito user for human requests, event source and event ID
for events, alarm ARN for alarms, calling agent and session IDs
for inter-agent calls) as structured fields so investigation
queries can filter by trigger source.

For tamper-evidence on the bucket itself, default to bucket
policies that deny delete and overwrite, MFA delete on the bucket,
and versioning. Where compliance requirements call for stronger
guarantees, consider enabling Amazon S3 Object Lock in governance
mode, which allows users with specific IAM permissions to override
retention settings when needed. Compliance mode helps prevent any
user (including the root account) from deleting or shortening
retention periods for the duration of the lock. Once configured,
this mode is irreversible, and a misconfiguration of the retention
period or scope can leave a customer unable to delete data they
need to delete (for example, to meet right-to-be-forgotten
requests). Use compliance mode only when there is a specific
regulatory requirement for it, and validate the retention
configuration against representative test data before applying it
broadly.

[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-telemetry.html) captures agent reasoning
chains, tool invocations, and decision artifacts automatically for
agents running on AgentCore Runtime. The session, trace, and span
hierarchy records reasoning steps, tool calls with inputs and
outputs, and memory operations. AgentCore outputs span data for
memory resources by default and publishes session-level metrics
viewable on the Amazon CloudWatch generative AI observability
page. For artifacts that need retention beyond the default
observability window or specific compliance controls, write the
full decision context to the dedicated S3 artifact store at each
significant decision point. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)
extends coverage with custom metrics, logs, and spans in agent
code.

[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/evaluations.html) complements logging by
continually scoring agent behavior on correctness, helpfulness,
tool selection accuracy, and safety. Results publish to Amazon CloudWatch alongside observability data for a unified view, and
Amazon CloudWatch alarms on evaluation scores detect behavioral
drift outside acceptable thresholds.

Tamper-evidence at the audit-trail level uses AWS CloudTrail with
log file validation across all accounts and regions where agents
operate. Log file validation produces SHA-256 hashes and RSA
signatures in a digest file that verifies log files have not been
modified, deleted, or forged after delivery. A dedicated S3 bucket
with cross-account access controls helps prevent the agent's own
IAM role from modifying or deleting logs.

Amazon Athena with AWS Glue Data Catalog makes the decision
artifact store queryable: an AWS Glue crawler scans the S3
artifact bucket and creates tables in the Data Catalog based on
the artifact schema, and Athena runs SQL queries directly against
S3 without loading data into a separate database. Investigation
queries such as "find all decisions made by agent X that
involved tool Y between dates A and B" become cheap to run.
Document standard investigation queries for common security
scenarios so investigators can work immediately during an
incident. This pattern (logs to Amazon S3, cataloged by AWS Glue,
queried with Amazon Athena) is an established forensic log
analytics approach recommended in the AWS Well-Architected
Security Pillar.

A lifecycle policy keeps storage costs proportional to access
patterns. Hot logs live in Amazon CloudWatch Logs for operational
monitoring (30 to 90 days), transition to Amazon S3 Standard for
medium-term retention (1 to 2 years), and archive to Amazon Glacier for long-term compliance retention (7+ years). Tag objects
with data classification and retention policy metadata so
lifecycle transitions are automated.

### Implementation steps

- **Enable Amazon Bedrock model
invocation logging:** Turn on Amazon Bedrock model
invocation logging and deliver to both Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3.
- **Mask sensitive data before it lands
in long-term storage:** Configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs data protection policies, verify masking behavior
across every logging destination in use, and add write-time
masking in agent code where the destination doesn't mask on
its own.
- **Create a dedicated, append-only
artifact bucket in a Log Archive account:** Create
an Amazon S3 bucket in a separate Log Archive account,
aligned with the
[AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html), with versioning
enabled and cross-account access controls that allow agent
write access but deny delete and overwrite operations.
- **Choose a retention-protection
model:** Default to bucket-policy-based protection
(deny delete, deny overwrite, MFA delete, versioning).
Evaluate Amazon S3 Object Lock in governance mode where
compliance requires stronger guarantees, and reserve
compliance mode for cases where there is a specific
regulatory requirement for it after validating the retention
scope and duration against representative test data.
- **Capture full traces through
AgentCore Observability:** Use
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-telemetry.html) to capture full agent
execution traces, and for artifacts needing longer retention
or compliance controls, write the full decision context to
the dedicated S3 artifact store at each significant decision
point.
- **Record initiator attributes on every
artifact:** Capture human session, event source and
event ID, alarm ARN, schedule rule ARN, calling agent ID,
and similar identifiers as structured fields on decision
artifacts and log entries.
- **Apply a consistent artifact key
schema:** Use
`agentId`, `sessionId`, `timestamp`, and `decisionType`
as the key schema for efficient retrieval during
investigations.
- **Deploy AgentCore Evaluations with
drift alarms:** Deploy
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/evaluations.html) with built-in and
custom evaluators, publish results to Amazon CloudWatch, and
configure alarms on evaluation scores to detect behavioral
drift.
- **Enable CloudTrail log file
validation:** Turn on AWS CloudTrail with log file
validation across all accounts and regions, storing logs in
a dedicated S3 bucket with cross-account access controls.
- **Make artifacts queryable with Athena
and AWS Glue:** Set up an AWS Glue crawler to scan
the S3 artifact bucket and create tables in the Data
Catalog, use Amazon Athena to query artifacts directly in
S3, and document standard investigation queries for common
security scenarios.
- **Implement tiered retention with
automation:** Define retention tiers (CloudWatch Logs for operational monitoring, S3 Standard for
medium-term, Amazon Glacier for long-term compliance) with
automated lifecycle transitions and data classification
tagging.
- **Encrypt all log and artifact
storage:** Use customer-managed AWS KMS keys with
key rotation enabled on every logging destination.

# AGENTSEC05-BP02 Implement distributed tracing for agent interactions

A request that hops across agents, queues, and event buses is only
investigable if a single identifier follows it end-to-end. Tracing
with both a trace ID for instrumented services and an
application-level correlation ID for asynchronous boundaries makes
cross-agent incidents reconstructable.

**Desired outcome:**

- You trace every request that flows through a multi-agent system
end-to-end with a single correlation identifier, so security
teams can reconstruct the complete chain of agent interactions
for traced operations.
- Service maps give real-time visibility into agent dependencies
and communication patterns.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Generating new trace IDs at each agent boundary rather than
propagating the original, breaking the correlation chain and
making it impossible to link related actions.
- Tracing only synchronous agent interactions and omitting
asynchronous operations (Amazon SQS messages, Amazon EventBridge
events), creating gaps that obscure the full execution path.
- Not instrumenting tool invocations within agent traces, losing
visibility into which external services were called and what
data was exchanged during execution.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Correlated traces across agent boundaries make every agent
execution reconstructable after the fact.
- Service maps and trace analysis surface unexpected communication
patterns, such as agents interacting with services outside their
normal dependency graph.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Two identifiers do the work together. A *trace
ID* is generated by the tracing system (Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals, AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry) and
follows a request through instrumented services. It is the
identifier the tracing backend uses to reconstruct spans into a
trace tree. A *correlation ID* is generated by
the application and propagated end-to-end, and it survives
boundaries where trace context is re-generated (most commonly
asynchronous messaging channels, where the consumer frequently
starts a new trace). Trace IDs give you the automatic correlation
where instrumentation is continuous. Correlation IDs give you
reliable linkage across the boundaries that instrumentation can't
traverse.

[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-telemetry.html) provides built-in tracing
for agents deployed on AgentCore Runtime. Sessions represent
complete user interactions, traces represent individual
request-response cycles, and spans represent specific operations
within a trace. AgentCore outputs span data for memory resources
by default, and session-level metrics are viewable on the Amazon CloudWatch generative AI observability page. The built-in
instrumentation captures the agent execution loop and propagates
trace context across agent boundaries without custom code.

For deeper visibility or for agents not running on AgentCore
Runtime, instrument agent code with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
(ADOT) to generate traces compatible with AWS X-Ray and
third-party observability platforms. Create spans for each
significant operation within an agent (model invocations, tool
calls, memory reads and writes, inter-agent communications) and
configure X-Ray sampling rules to capture 100% of traces for
security-critical operations while using statistical sampling for
high-volume routine operations.

Correlation ID propagation is the primary concern in all
agent-to-agent communications. Include both the correlation ID and
the current trace ID in inter-agent messages, API calls, and event
payloads, so the full execution chain can be reconstructed from
any point. For asynchronous operations through Amazon SQS or
Amazon EventBridge, propagate both IDs through message attributes.
The correlation ID preserves end-to-end linkage even when the
tracing system starts a new trace on the consumer side.

The Amazon CloudWatch generative AI observability page provides
agent-specific session and trace metrics for AgentCore Runtime.
For cross-service visualization that covers non-agent components
in the same request path (databases, queues, downstream services),
Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens renders a service map of agent
interactions and surfaces unexpected communication patterns.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights queries identify traces with
unusual patterns: agents calling unexpected services, traces with
abnormally high tool invocation counts, or traces that span
unexpected geographic regions.

### Implementation steps

- **Verify built-in AgentCore
tracing:** For agents on AgentCore Runtime, confirm
[Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-telemetry.html) is capturing session,
trace, and span data and review the default metrics on the
Amazon CloudWatch generative AI observability page.
- **Instrument custom agents with
ADOT:** For custom agents or deeper visibility,
instrument agent code with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to
generate spans for model invocations, tool calls, memory
operations, and inter-agent communications.
- **Propagate correlation IDs through
async boundaries:** Include the correlation ID and
current trace ID in all inter-agent messages, API calls, and
event payloads, and propagate them through Amazon SQS
message attributes and Amazon EventBridge event detail for
asynchronous operations.
- **Configure X-Ray sampling by
risk:** Capture 100% of traces for
security-critical operations and statistical sampling for
routine operations through AWS X-Ray sampling rules.
- **Visualize service maps and detect
anomalies:** Use Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens to
visualize agent service maps and build Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights queries to detect anomalous trace patterns.
- **Set trace retention:**
Configure trace retention policies that match your incident
investigation and compliance requirements.
