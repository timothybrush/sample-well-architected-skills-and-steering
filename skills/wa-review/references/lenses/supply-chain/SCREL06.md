# SCREL06-BP01 Use machine learning models to analyze historical data and external factors, predicting disruptions and optimizing inventory

Implement machine learning models that analyze patterns across
historical supply chain disruptions, correlating them with
external factors such as weather events, geopolitical
developments, and economic indicators to identify emerging risk
patterns. Train predictive algorithms on comprehensive datasets
that combine internal operational metrics with external variables
to forecast potential disruption impacts on specific supply chain
nodes and transportation lanes.

Deploy these predictive insights through automated decision
support systems that recommend preemptive inventory positioning,
transportation mode shifts, and supplier diversification
strategies before disruptions materialize. Continuously refine
these models through feedback loops that compare predicted
outcomes with actual events, enabling progressive improvement in
disruption forecasting accuracy and response optimization over
time.

**Desired outcome**: A proactive
supply chain that adapts to potential risks before they occur,
minimizing disruptions and maintaining service levels.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Improves operational agility, reduces
response times, and enhances supply chain resilience.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Predictive analytics involves using machine learning models to
anticipate supply chain disruptions. Use Amazon Forecast for
demand prediction and Amazon SageMaker AI to develop custom models
for disruption prediction. Continuously updating and training
these models with the latest data facilitates ongoing accuracy
and effectiveness.

### Implementation steps

- **Implement predictive
models**: Use Amazon Forecast and Amazon SageMaker AI for predictive analytics.
- **Analyze historical
data**: Integrate historical and external data to
train the models.
- **Update models
continuously**: Retrain models with updated data
to improve predictions.
- **Develop mitigation
strategies**: Use predictions to plan inventory
and logistics adjustments proactively.
