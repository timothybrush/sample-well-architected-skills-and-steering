# SCCOST01-BP01 Optimize integration and collaboration across the supply chain management

Supply chain optimization, enhanced by location intelligence, can
minimize unnecessary miles, resulting in a cost-effective approach
to logistics and transportation management.

**Desired outcome:** An integrated
and optimized supply chain system with real-time and accurate
inventory or location.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Reduced cost and better customer
satisfaction.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Capture real-time tracking events to orchestrate and streamline
operations and provide visibility to your customers, while
deploying cloud-based integration systems to automate and
streamline communication with suppliers, transporters, and
service providers. This significantly reduces manual data entry
and processing tasks, leading to improved operational efficiency
and cost reduction.

### Implementation steps

- Implement real-time tracking systems to capture and
process supply chain events as they occur.
- Deploy cloud-based integration systems to automate
communication with suppliers, transporters, and service
providers.
- Establish automated data synchronization processes to
reduce manual data entry and processing tasks.
- Create unified dashboards that provide real-time
visibility into supply chain operations for all
stakeholders.
- Implement location intelligence solutions to optimize
routing and reduce unnecessary transportation costs.
- Monitor integration performance and continuously optimize
processes to maximize cost savings and operational
efficiency.

# SCCOST01-BP02 Adopt a flexible and scalable cloud infrastructure

A typical supply chain landscape will include ERPs, warehouse
management systems (WMS), and transportation management systems
(TMS) running on a large infrastructure that needs to be reliable,
scalable and optimized for cost and performance.

**Desired outcome:** Pay as you go
cloud infrastructure configured with auto scaling to expand or
shrink as per demand of the workload. Cloud service quotas
configured for peak usage.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Reduced cost and better resiliency.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Use AWS' pay-as-you-go model to align costs with actual usage
and demand fluctuations, while implementing auto scaling
capabilities to automatically adjust resources based on workload
demands. Configure service quotas to accommodate peak usage for
respective services and use containerization and serverless
technologies for improved resource utilization and cost
optimization.

### Implementation steps

- Assess current infrastructure costs and identify
opportunities for pay-as-you-go optimization.
- Implement auto-scaling policies for compute, storage, and
database resources based on demand patterns.
- Configure appropriate service quotas to handle peak usage
while avoiding unnecessary over-provisioning.
- Deploy containerization technologies to improve resource
utilization and reduce infrastructure costs.
- Implement serverless architectures for event-driven
workloads to minimize idle resource costs.
- Establish cost monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track
spending and identify optimization opportunities.
