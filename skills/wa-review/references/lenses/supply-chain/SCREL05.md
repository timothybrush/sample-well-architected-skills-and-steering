# SCREL05-BP01 Deploy IoT-based monitoring systems to track temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors during transit

Deploy comprehensive IoT-based monitoring systems throughout your
supply chain to continuously track critical environmental
conditions like temperature, humidity, shock, light exposure, and
location for sensitive products during storage and transit.
Configure these systems with product-specific thresholds that
trigger immediate alerts when measurements deviate from acceptable
ranges, enabling rapid intervention before product quality is
compromised.

Implement a centralized monitoring dashboard that visualizes
real-time condition data across all shipments, with drill-down
capabilities to investigate anomalies and historical trend
analysis to identify recurring issues. These monitoring
capabilities should integrate with quality management systems to
automatically document compliance with regulatory requirements and
customer specifications while providing complete chain-of-custody
verification for sensitive or high-value products.

**Desired**
**outcome**: A supply chain where
environmental conditions are actively monitored and controlled to
improve product quality.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Reduces losses due to spoilage or damage,
increases customer satisfaction, and compliance with regulatory
requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To mitigate risks of spoilage or damage, deploy IoT sensors to
monitor environmental conditions such as temperature and
humidity. Use AWS IoT SiteWise to analyze this data in real-time
and implement automated alerts to detect deviations. Regular
testing of IoT sensors improves reliability, enabling proactive
management of risks during transit.

### Implementation steps

- **Install IoT sensors**:
Deploy sensors to monitor critical environmental
conditions during transit.
- **Analyze data in
real-time**: Use AWS IoT SiteWise to collect and
analyze sensor data.
- **Set up alerts**:
Implement automated alerts for deviations in environmental
conditions.
- **Test and maintain
sensors**: Regularly test sensors to enable
accuracy and reliability.
