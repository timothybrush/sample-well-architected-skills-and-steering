# SCSEC11-BP01 Develop and implement a comprehensive incident response plan

Establish a comprehensive incident response plan tailored
specifically for supply chain disruptions that clearly defines
roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures across all
stakeholders including suppliers and logistics partners. Regularly
conduct tabletop exercises and simulations to test the
effectiveness of response protocols under various supply chain
threat scenarios, making sure teams are prepared to act decisively
during actual incidents.

Implement automated detection mechanisms that can quickly identify
potential supply chain security breaches or operational
disruptions, triggering appropriate response workflows. Maintain
secure communication channels and documentation procedures that
enable effective coordination during incidents while preserving
evidence for post-incident analysis and continuous improvement of
security controls.

**Desired outcome:** A
comprehensive and well-tested incident response plan tailored for
supply chain operations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Faster response times to security incidents
and minimized impact on supply chain operations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Maintain an up to date incident response plan specifically for
supply chain incidents, with defined roles, communication
procedures, and playbooks that are regularly reviewed and tested
through tabletop exercises. Use AWS Security Hub CSPM to aggregate
security alerts and compliance checks across AWS accounts and
supply chain partners' connected accounts, providing a
centralized view of security posture.

### Implementation steps

- Develop a comprehensive incident response plan
specifically tailored for supply chain operations,
including defined roles, responsibilities, and escalation
procedures for all stakeholders.
- Implement centralized security monitoring and alerting
systems to aggregate findings from multiple sources and
provide unified visibility into supply chain security
posture.
- Establish automated incident detection and response
workflows that can quickly identify and respond to supply
chain-specific security threats and operational
disruptions.
- Configure comprehensive logging and monitoring across all
supply chain infrastructure to enable forensic analysis
and incident investigation capabilities.
- Create secure backup and recovery procedures for critical
supply chain data and systems, with immutable backups
stored in separate secured environments.
- Conduct regular tabletop exercises and incident response
simulations to test and refine response procedures, making
sure all teams are prepared for various supply chain
threat scenarios.
