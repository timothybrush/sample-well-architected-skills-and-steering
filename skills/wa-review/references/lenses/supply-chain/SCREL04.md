# SCREL04-BP01 Implement a centralized inventory and order management system integrated with all warehouses, suppliers, and sales channels

Use event-driven architectures to propagate updates across the
supply chain. Implement a centralized inventory and order
management system that provides a single source of truth for
product availability, allocations, and fulfillment status across
all physical and digital channels. Establish real-time integration
with warehouse management systems, supplier portals, and sales
systems to synchronize inventory movements and order status
changes throughout the fulfillment lifecycle.

Deploy event-driven architecture patterns that take immediate
actions when significant changes occur, such as automatically
reallocating inventory when stock levels reach thresholds or
initiating replenishment workflows when demand signals change.
This interconnected system should support sophisticated allocation
rules that optimize inventory placement based on factors like
customer promise dates, fulfillment costs, and service level
agreements while maintaining data consistency across all supply
chain nodes.

**Desired outcome:** An integrated
supply chain system where inventory levels and order statuses are
consistent and accurate across all nodes.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Helps prevent customer dissatisfaction caused
by overselling or delays and reduces excess inventory costs by
maintaining accurate stock levels.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

To enable real-time synchronization of inventory and order data,
adopt an event-driven architecture that propagates updates
seamlessly across the supply chain. Tools like AWS EventBridge
or Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) can
handle real-time event streaming to enable data sharing across
all nodes immediately. Data integration from various sources,
such as warehouses and sales channels, should utilize services
like AWS Glue or Amazon AppFlow. Regular audits of
synchronization logs will help identify and address
inconsistencies promptly, safeguarding the accuracy of supply
chain data.

### Implementation steps

- **Set up event-driven
architecture**: Configure AWS EventBridge or
Apache Kafka to manage real-time data streaming for
inventory and order updates.
- **Integrate data nodes**:
Use AWS Glue or Amazon AppFlow to connect data sources
like warehouses, suppliers, and online storefronts.
- **Audit data regularly**:
Implement scheduled audits of synchronization logs to help
with data consistency across all nodes.
- **Monitor system
performance**: Deploy monitoring tools to track
the efficiency of data synchronization and resolve issues
as they arise.
