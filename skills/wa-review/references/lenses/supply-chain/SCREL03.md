# SCREL03-BP01 Integrate route optimization tools with real-time data from logistics providers and IoT sensors to dynamically adjust routes

Implement advanced route optimization tools that continuously
recalculate optimal delivery paths by incorporating real-time data
streams from traffic systems, weather services, and vehicle
telematics. Connect these optimization engines with IoT sensors
deployed across the logistics network to capture immediate
feedback on road conditions, vehicle performance, and cargo
status, enabling dynamic rerouting decisions when disruptions
occur. Establish bidirectional integration with logistics
partners' systems to synchronize schedule changes, resource
availability, and delivery constraints across the extended
transportation network. This intelligent routing environment
should support multi-objective optimization that balances
competing priorities like fuel efficiency, delivery time windows,
driver hours-of-service constraints, and carbon emissions targets
while adapting to changing conditions throughout the execution
cycle.

**Desired outcome**: A
transportation network capable of rerouting shipments to minimize
delays and allow on-time delivery.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Reduces delivery lead times, avoids penalties
for late deliveries, and improves overall supply chain efficiency.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Dynamic route adjustment relies on integrating route
optimization tools with real-time data. Services such as AWS IoT Core provides real-time location tracking, while Amazon Location
Service can help optimize routes based on current conditions.
Collaborate with logistics providers that offer dynamic routing
capabilities to enable rerouting decisions that are efficiently
executed.

### Implementation steps

- **Deploy real-time
tracking**: Use AWS IoT Core to track shipment
locations.
- **Integrate route optimization
tools**: Use Amazon Location Service for dynamic
route planning.
- **Collaborate with logistics
providers**: Partner with providers offering
advanced routing capabilities.
- **Monitor rerouting
efficiency**: Regularly evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of routing adjustments.
