# ADVSUS03-BP01 Use caching techniques to prevent frequent data access

Implement caching techniques to store frequently accessed data in
cache, preventing repeated data retrieval and thereby reducing
computing time and energy consumption for advertising workloads.

## Implementation guidance

- Implement caching strategies for advertising content and
data to minimize frequent data access and reduce computing
time and energy consumption.
- Use AWS caching services like
[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) (for in-memory caching) and
[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) (for content delivery network caching) to
store frequently accessed data closer to the consumers,
reducing latency and compute requirements.
- Consider using
[AWS Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) and CloudFront Functions to run
lightweight logic at edge locations, minimizing the need for
data transfer to centralized servers and reducing overall
energy consumption.

## Key AWS services

- [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/) (for optimizing data transfer over
the AWS Cloud)
- [AWS Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) (for energy-efficient compute
instances)
