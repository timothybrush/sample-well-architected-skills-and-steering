# ADVOPS02-BP01 Implement monitoring across each layer of your advertising stack including infrastructure, applications, and user experience

Ensuring operational excellence in advertising workloads requires
a holistic approach to monitoring. This best practice emphasizes
the importance of implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions
that span all layers of the advertising stack. The advertising
stack includes the ad-serving infrastructure, data pipelines,
application performance, and user experience. By monitoring these
various components, you can gain a complete understanding of the
overall health and performance of your advertising workload. This
understanding helps you identify and address issues, optimize
resource utilization, and deliver a seamless customer experience.
With a multi-layered monitoring approach, you can proactively
detect and resolve problems before they impact your business.

## Implementation guidance

Monitor and set KPIs and SLOs for infrastructure services using
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for services like
[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
and [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/). Set up CloudWatch Alarms for resource utilization,
performance, and availability.

# ADVOPS02-BP02 Collect and analyze detailed metrics for successful operations and ad campaigns

Advertising workloads can experience significant spikes in traffic
and resource utilization, which can impact performance and
availability. To maintain observability across these dynamic
workloads, collect granular, one-second metrics with near
real-time latency. Use advanced analytics, machine learning, and
anomaly detection to continuously analyze this data and
proactively identify issues before they impact campaigns. This
level of observability and proactive issue detection improves the
reliability and responsiveness of your advertising infrastructure,
even during periods of high demand.

## Implementation guidance

Consider the following for collecting important ad-serving
metrics:

- **Granular metrics:** Collect
metrics at a one-second granularity to capture spikes and
fluctuations in advertising workloads. Key metrics to
monitor include:

**Bid requests per
second:** Number of bid requests received.
- **Bid response time:**
Time taken to respond to bid requests.
- **Successful bids:**
Number of successful bids placed.
- **Bid win rate:**
Percentage of bids won compared to total bids placed.
- **Latency metrics:**
Measure network latency, processing time, and database
query times.

For database metrics for RTB platforms:

- **Read and write latency:**
Measure the time taken for read and write operations in your
databases including
[DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html)
and
[Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-metrics.html).
- **Throughput:** Monitor
[read
and write capacity units](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html) to verify that your database
can handle the load.
- **Error rates:** Track the
number of failed read/write operations.
- **Connection count:** Monitor
the number of
[active
connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-metrics.html) to the database.

Consider the following for effective analysis of ad serving
insights:

- **Anomaly detection:** Use
Amazon CloudWatch anomaly detection to detect anomalies in
your metrics based on historical data patterns
automatically. This can help identify potential issues
before they impact campaigns.

Create useful alarms for monitoring and alerting. Configure
CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics such as:

- **High latency:** Set alarms
for when bid response times exceed a defined threshold (for
example, 100ms).
- **Low bid win rate:**
Initiate alerts if the bid win rate drops below a specific
percentage.
- **Database latency:** Create alarms for read or write
latency thresholds to ensure database performance.

Configure your notification mechanisms. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alerts to relevant
stakeholders using email or SMS when alarms go off. This makes
it possible for the appropriate teams to respond quickly to
potential issues.

Other important considerations for observability of advertising
workloads:

- **Impact on cost:**
CloudWatch has charges for custom metrics, alarms, and API
requests, which can add to the overall AWS costs. The cost
can vary based on the number of metrics, alarms, and API
calls configured. SNS has charges for the number of
notifications sent, which can also contribute to the overall
cost.
- **To reduce impact on cost:**
Analyze the expected usage patterns and configure CloudWatch
and SNS based on specific needs to optimize costs. Consider
cost-optimized approaches, such as using sampling or
aggregation for high-volume metrics, to reduce the number of
custom metrics and API calls.
- **Impact on latency:** The
monitoring and logging solutions recommended, when
implemented correctly, should have minimal impact on the
latency of your advertising workloads. CloudWatch provides
near real-time data ingestion and processing, which helps in
quickly detecting and diagnosing issues. However, it's
important to verify that the monitoring and logging
solutions are non-blocking and do not introduce additional
latency in your critical advertising workflows.
- **To reduce impact on
latency:** Implement monitoring and logging
solutions using asynchronous, non-blocking approaches to
minimize the impact on latency. Consider using sampling or
batching techniques to reduce the number of API calls and
optimize the performance of your monitoring and logging
solutions.
- **Ad fraud metrics:** Monitor
invalid traffic rates, bot detection rates, and suspicious
activity patterns.
- **Brand safety metrics:**
Track content classification accuracy, moderation response
times, and policy violation rates.
- **Measurement consistency:**
Monitor cross-system measurement discrepancies,
attribution model performance, and conversion path
integrity.
