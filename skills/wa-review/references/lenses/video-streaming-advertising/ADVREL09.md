## Implementation guidance

- Deploy multiple third-party verification providers for
cross-validation
- Implement automated failover mechanisms for measurement
systems
- Use data quality checks and anomaly detection
- Maintain backup measurement methodologies
- Configure automated retry mechanisms for failed
measurements
- Implement circuit breakers for degraded third-party
services
- Set up monitoring and alerting for measurement system
health
