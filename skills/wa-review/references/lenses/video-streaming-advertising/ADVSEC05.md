# ADVSEC05-BP01 Validate and sanitize content before running a campaign

Content validation is essential to mitigate ad fraud and block
unwanted content from reaching ad audience.

## Implementation guidance

Consider using
Amazon S3 which can serve as a secure, scalable storage
solution for advertising content. It allows for simple
management and distribution of assets. S3 can be configured
with strict access controls and encryption to maintain the
security of the advertisement files. Additionally, Amazon
Rekognition can be utilized to analyze images and videos in
advertisements, verifying they meet solution standards and
don't contain inappropriate content. This AI-powered service
can detect objects, scenes, and activities in visual content.
For additional monitoring and auditing, consider using AWS
CloudTrail to provide a record of actions taken by users,
roles, or AWS services in the ad serving solution, which is
essential for security analysis and compliance audits.
