# FSISUS08: How do you optimize your resource usage?

Review and optimize your resource usage by implementing either a pub/sub or pull
mechanism instead of relying on a polling approach.

## FSISUS08-BP01 Use event-driven architecture

Implement either a pub/sub or pull mechanism instead of using a polling approach.

### Prescriptive guidance

- Implement event-driven architecture where possible to avoid idling of resources
running and waiting for state changes.
- If event-driven architecture is not possible, modify the capacity of individual
components to prevent idling downstream resources waiting for input.
- Avoid polling APIs or queues, instead have components and services subscribe to
events or be notified of changes to reduce the idling of resources.
- Implement auto scaling and serverless architectures for generative AI
workloads.
- Use managed generative AI services like Amazon Bedrock to optimize resource
utilization.
- Apply model optimization techniques like quantization and pruning.
