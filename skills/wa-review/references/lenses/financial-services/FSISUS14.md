# FSISUS14: Do you have multi-architecture images for grid computing systems?

Multi-architecture image support for a particular workload makes it easier for you to
build different images and thus different architectures and operating systems from the same
source and refer to them all by the same abstract manifest. The manifest specifies the
layers of system content that make up the image as well as its runtime characteristics and
configuration. Having a multi-architecture image increases the flexibility of the workload
thus increases the opportunity to use hardware that may be more sustainable.

## FSISUS14-BP01 Use instances with higher energy efficiency

**Prescriptive guidance**

- [AWS Graviton-based instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-graviton-performance-testing/what-is-aws-graviton.html) use up to 60% less energy than comparable
EC2 instances.

## FSISUS14-BP02 Design applications that can use different Amazon EC2 instance types

**Prescriptive guidance**

- This is what we would call a flexible workload. In contrast, inflexible workloads
rely only on a few instance types. These instances types may be less energy efficient
than others.
- Flexible workloads are ideal for Spot Instances. Running workloads on Spot
Instances is generally considered more energy efficient than On-Demand Instances
because Spot is overhead required for the Amazon EC2 On-Demand service to run.
- Use Amazon EC2's spare capacity with Spot Instances to extract the same value, which
increases the total value generated from the Amazon EC2 environment as a whole.

## FSISUS14-BP03 Adopt a serverless, event-driven architecture

### Prescriptive guidance

- Consider using a serverless, event-driven architecture to maximize overall
resource utilization. Serverless architecture removes the requirement to run and
maintain physical servers since AWS handles this on your behalf.
- The cost of serverless architectures generally correlates with the level of
usage, thus increases your workload's cost efficiency.
- **Implementation guidance:** Maximize energy efficiency
as well as availability by building multi- architecture workloads that can run on a
variety of Spot Instances. It is important to account for error precision when
expanding compiler options on varying processors.
- **Service recommendations:** Use the following services
to achieve your goal:

[Amazon Simple Queue Service and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-cost-effective-queue-workers-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/)
- [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/creating-multi-architecture-docker-images-to-support-graviton2-using-aws-codebuild-and-aws-codepipeline/)
- [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/)
- [AWS Parallel
Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/)

- Determine which of your workloads is suitable for use of floating-point
accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Consider testing with a cluster of instances
to see how well it performs at scale.
- For intensive financial simulations and calculations, test the number of bits
that are required to achieve your floating point precision and consider reducing
number of bits by selecting different floating-point formats, including bfloat16,
that's supported by AWS Graviton.
- Develop multi-architecture generative AI model containers for different
instance types.
- Support both GPU and AWS Trainium instances for generative AI workloads.
- Optimize generative AI models for different hardware architectures (like x86,
ARM, or Graviton).
