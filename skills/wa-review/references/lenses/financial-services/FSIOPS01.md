# FSIOPS01: Have you defined risk management roles for the cloud?

Financial institutions typically adopt a Three Lines of Defense model to improve
effectiveness of risk management. The second and third lines of defense must have the
appropriate skills and training necessary to understand the risks involved in the delivery
of business services using cloud - services owned and managed by the first line. Establish
clear roles and responsibilities both within and across the three lines of defense's
functions to verify the effectiveness and auditability of the cloud operating model.
Reassess these roles and responsibilities at regular intervals to keep the governance model
efficient and effective.

Financial institutions deploying generative AI workloads must extend their traditional Three Lines of Defense model to address unique risks associated with large language models (LLMs) and foundation models. Establish specialized governance for model selection and validation, implement robust output validation and bias monitoring processes, verify algorithmic explainability and accountability, and develop specialized oversight capabilities for AI/ML risks across model development, deployment, and ongoing operations.

## FSIOPS01-BP01 Define roles and responsibilities across risk functions

As explained in the preceding general design principles section, financial
institutions typically adopt a Three Lines of Defense model to improve effectiveness of
risk management. The second and third lines of defense must have the appropriate skills
and training necessary to understand the risks involved in the delivery of business
services using the cloud (services owned and managed by the first line). Clear roles and
responsibilities need to be established both within and across the three lines of
defense's functions to verify the effectiveness and auditability of the cloud operating
model. These roles and responsibilities must be reassessed at regular intervals to keep
the governance model efficient and effective.

### Prescriptive guidance

The roles and responsibilities of each of the three lines of defense should be
clearly communicated and understood. Publishing a RACI (Responsible, Accountable,
Consulted, Informed) matrix on an intranet or wiki page is a good way to reduce
misunderstandings about which role owns each activity. Periodic review of these roles
and responsibilities should occur more frequently immediately after they are defined or
dramatically changed, and can be less frequent otherwise. The people who fill roles
within the three lines of defense should be documented as well, and membership in these
roles should require a standard level of training in order to consistently handle risk
management.

## FSIOPS01-BP02 Engage with your risk management and internal audit functions to implement a process for the approval of cloud risk controls

Significant changes in technology necessitate a refreshed assessment of new potential
risks and their validations. Technology changes include migrating to the cloud, use of
newer database tools, extensive mobile application usage, and AI/ML technologies. These
changes may present risks to the existing control environment such that it may be unable
to mitigate the original identiﬁed risks, but also may not be eﬀective across a much
broader spectrum of changes. Engagement with the risk and internal audit functions helps
align with required governance obligations as cloud usage increases. This engagement needs
to include documentation and demonstration by the first line, to the second and third
lines, of the controls, technology, and processes that have been implemented to secure and
operate the cloud environment. This process can contain a regular review cadence for new
controls, so the first line can evolve their implementations as needed to quickly and
safely adopt best practices for new threats.

### Prescriptive guidance

All stakeholders from the three lines of defense should be invited to participate
in suggesting, evaluating, and approving changes to risk controls. A periodic review of
risk controls, as well as an out-of-cycle mechanism to suggest updates, should be
clearly documented and understood by all stakeholders. The lifecycle of a risk control
(suggestion, review, approval, training, implementation, and retirement) should also be
documented and understood. Prior to implementation of a specific risk control, metrics
should be identified to indicate the effectiveness of the control. These metrics should
be generated and compiled automatically and should be reviewed periodically throughout
the risk control's lifecycle. Thresholds that indicate effectiveness should be
established, and the continued breach of those thresholds should prompt review of the
risk control, with an expectation that it be updated or retired.

## FSIOPS01-BP03 Implement a process for adopting appropriate risk appetites

Failures can happen at any time. The appropriate risk authority within the firm (for
example, the board of directors, chief risk officers, or business risk officers) needs to
evaluate the criticality of a business process (and the underlying workloads that support
that process) and specify the level of availability that the firm requires for that
process. This must take into consideration the potential impact that a disruption of that
process has on the firm, the market, the customers, and regulatory bodies managing the
financial infrastructure, as well as the cost of operating the workload in a high
availability mode weighed against business agility and innovation. Working backwards from
these risk appetites allows you to drive the operational priorities and the resiliency
design choices of cloud workloads supporting business services in a prioritized manner.
Setting clear risk appetites allows for effective risk management and governance.

### Prescriptive guidance

All workloads should be categorized based on their criticality and associated risk
tolerance. In financial services organizations, this classification has often already
occurred as part of disaster recovery planning, and these risk categorizations can be
reused elsewhere. Once risk categories are established, requirements should be
identified to be applied to workloads within each risk category. Examples of
requirements might be recovery time objective (RTO) or recovery point objective (RPO)
expectations, use of encryption for data in-transit and at rest, and geographies within
which data must be stored. Building upon these requirements, preferred architectural
patterns should be identified that help meet the needs of each risk category in an
efficient and manageable way. Publishing these reference architectures is a good way to
encourage their adoption, as it simplifies the use of a consistent and preferred
architecture, and also provides a foundation for automation.

## FSIOPS01-BP04 Define a generative AI model risk management framework

Establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating, approving, and monitoring generative AI models used in production. This framework should include model inventory management, risk tiering based on use case criticality, and clear approval processes for model deployment and updates. Document acceptable use policies for generative AI, prohibited use cases, and escalation procedures for model-related incidents, and address governance for both internally developed and third-party foundation models.

### Prescriptive guidance

Create a generative AI model registry documenting all models in use, their versions, approved use cases, and risk classifications, training data sources, and model dependencies.

Implement a formal model validation process as well as comprehensive model evaluation capabilities including automated quality and safety assessments with guardrails for hallucination detection, bias and continuous drift detection, model explainability, fairness, and ongoing compliance monitoring.

Establish clear ownership and accountability for each generative AI model across the three lines of defense.

Use Amazon SageMaker AI Model Registry and AWS Service Catalog to manage approved model versions and deployment patterns. Verify that the registry supports comprehensive audit trails and regulatory reporting requirements.

Establish model retirement and rollback procedures for underperforming or problematic models with clear triggers and processes.

Implement governance processes for third-party foundation models and API services, including vendor risk assessment and ongoing monitoring.

## FSIOPS01-BP05 Implement human-in-the-loop validation for critical processes

Implement human-in-the-loop for critical processes by establishing systematic review workflows where subject matter experts validate AI-generated outputs, especially low-confidence predictions and high-stakes decisions, using tools to create feedback loops that enable continuous model improvement, improve regulatory adherence, and maintain appropriate human oversight for decisions impacting critical business processes or customer experiences.

### Prescriptive guidance

For high-risk use cases customer-facing decisions, regulatory reporting, or financial calculations, implement mandatory human review processes. Design workflows that require human validation before generative AI outputs are used in critical business processes.

Establish clear escalation procedures and conflict resolution processes when human reviewers disagree with AI recommendations.

Implement comprehensive audit trail requirements that log all human interventions, rationales, timestamps, and reviewer identities.

Ensure human reviewers receive appropriate AI training and maintain current domain expertise for their review areas.

Create feedback loops to capture human reviewer insights for continuous model improvement.

Implement monitoring and reporting on human override rates and patterns to identify potential model performance issues.
