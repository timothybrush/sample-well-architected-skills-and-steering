# FSIPERF08: How do you optimize AI model inference performance?

Financial services AI applications require sophisticated
inference optimization to meet real-time performance
requirements while maintaining regulatory compliance and
accuracy standards.

## FSIPERF08-BP01 Implement inference acceleration techniques

Apply specialized optimization techniques to reduce model
inference latency and improve throughput for financial AI
workloads.

### Optimization strategies:

- Remove unnecessary model parameters while maintaining
accuracy for financial predictions.
- Create smaller, faster models that maintain the accuracy of
larger models for specific financial tasks.
- Combine multiple neural network layers to reduce computation
overhead.
- Use gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training to
reduce memory requirements.

### Implementation guidance:

- Use AWS Inferentia2 chips with the Neuron SDK for optimized
transformer model inference.
- Leverage NVIDIA TensorRT on GPU instances for accelerated
deep learning inference.
- Implement ONNX Runtime for cross-platform model optimization
and deployment.
- Apply Apache TVM for automated optimization of machine
learning models.

## FSIPERF08-BP02 Optimize real-time inference for financial applications

Configure inference infrastructure to meet the stringent
latency requirements of financial services applications such
as fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and real-time risk
assessment.

### Real-time optimization techniques:

- Keep models loaded in memory to eliminate cold start
latency.
- Maintain persistent connections to inference endpoints to
reduce network overhead.
- Use intelligent load balancing to route requests to the
optimal inference endpoint.
- Implement asynchronous inference for batch predictions
within acceptable latency bounds.

### Performance monitoring and tuning:

- Configure Amazon CloudWatch metrics for inference latency,
throughput, and error rates.
- Set up automated alerts for performance degradation that
could impact financial operations.
- Implement canary deployments for testing model performance
improvements in production.
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing of inference request
paths through financial AI systems.
