# LSSEC01-BP01 Implement the principle of separation of duties

For users with increased privileges, it is important to distribute
system administration activities, so no one administrator can hide
their activities or control an entire system. Separation of duties
can mitigate risk on critical tasks by requiring separate requesters
and approvers for a task. A common example is the use of an approver
during the
[running
of an automation on AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/running-automations-require-approvals.html). This principle can
be used to implement numerous tasks including controlling access to
your cloud resources. Use roles with limited permissions based on
functional needs when increased privileges are not required.

**Desired outcome:** Administrative
tasks related to GxP data stores require approvals.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Failure to implement a least privilege administration model.
- Lack of approvals in administration workflows.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By implementing a least-privilege model and
separating duties, appropriate control over access to GxP related
resources can be demonstrated.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Determine which administrative tasks may have the potential to
impact GxP data integrity. For each of these tasks, separate task
approval from task execution.

Configure roles with least privilege to be used for routine
functions that do not require administrative permissions.

### Implementation steps

- Introduce approval steps into automated administrative
workflows.
- Set required IAM permissions as needed.

# LSSEC01-BP02 Maintain a history of IAM configurations and changes over time

By logging the IAM policy that was assigned to an IAM user, group,
or role, you can determine the permissions that belonged to a user
at a specific time. For example, you can view whether a user had
permission to modify settings on a specific date in the past.

**Desired outcome:** A complete
history of IAM configurations is maintained and available for
review.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Provide the ability to view the IAM policy that
was assigned to an IAM user, group, or role over time.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Customize AWS Config to record configuration changes to IAM global
resources in your home Region.

### Implementation steps

- Determine a home AWS Region where you want AWS Config to
record and store configuration changes to IAM resources, as
the same IAM data is available in different AWS Regions.
- In your home region, enable recording
by [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/view-manage-resource.html) and enable recording of global resources or
select specific IAM resources.
- Create a service control policy (SCP) to stop recording
being turned off.

# LSSEC01-BP03 Set up alerts for IAM configuration changes and perform audits

Compliance-related access rules should be automated with alerting or
automated risk mitigation actions.

**Desired outcome:** Ability to
mitigate the risk of irregular access configurations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Set up alerts for monitoring activities by users with increased
privileges.

Perform periodic audits of control effectiveness.

### Implementation steps

- [Set
up alerts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-alerts-when-your-iam-configuration-changes/) to notify on AWS IAM configuration changes
including when an
[IAM user is created](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/send-a-notification-when-an-iam-user-is-created.html) or when conflicting permissions are
added to a user or role, such as being able to approve its
own requests on a given workflow.

The added notification can be set up using a combination
of
[AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html),
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html), and
[Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html).

- Automate permissions management and refinement through
[IAM Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/access-analyzer/) with security integration workflows
that alert teams to access policy changes. For unused roles,
access keys, or
passwords, [IAM Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/access-analyzer/) provides quick links in the console
to assist you to delete them. For unused permissions, IAM Access Analyzer reviews your existing policies and
recommends a refined policy that is tailored to your access
activity.
