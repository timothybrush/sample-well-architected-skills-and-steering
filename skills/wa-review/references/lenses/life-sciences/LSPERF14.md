# LSPERF14-BP02 Evaluate multi-CDN architectures with intelligent traffic routing capabilities

Evaluate content delivery network (CDN) providers focusing on their
performance in academic and research regions. Create a dynamic
multi-CDN system that routes content based on real-time performance,
content type, and destination. Test features like origin shields,
cache optimization for scientific data, and API configuration.

is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Evaluate and select CDN providers based on their performance in
academic and research regions. Analyze capabilities for handling
specialized research content types and assess integration with
research networks. Create comprehensive provider profiles
