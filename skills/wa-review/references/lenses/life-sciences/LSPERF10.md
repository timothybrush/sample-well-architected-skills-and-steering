# LSPERF10-BP01 Implement tiered caching architecture with clinical data classification and lifecycle management

Deploy multi-tier caching that categorizes clinical reference data
by access frequency and criticality (memory-based caching for
ultra-high frequency data like active drug formularies and emergency
protocols, and distributed caching for diagnostic codes and lab
reference ranges). Establish automated lifecycle management with
real-time updates for safety-critical information such as drug
recalls and adverse event alerts. Use scheduled refresh cycles for
stable reference data like anatomical classifications and billing
codes based on clinical data volatility patterns.

**Desired outcome:** Implement
intelligent caching architecture that maintains optimal clinical
data access through multi-tier classification, propagates critical
updates while managing reference data cycles, automates lifecycle
management across cache tiers, and delivers reliable safety-critical
data through verified priority-based mechanisms.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish multi-level caching framework that aligns with clinical
data criticality and access patterns. This foundation enables
optimal performance for different data categories while providing
for appropriate refresh cycles.

Implement comprehensive classification mechanisms for different
types of clinical reference data. This framework should categorize
data based on access frequency, criticality, and volatility
requirements.

Deploy automated lifecycle management processes for different data
categories. This system should handle real-time updates for
critical data while managing scheduled refreshes for stable
reference data.

Design specialized handling for high-priority clinical updates and
alerts. This propagates critical information while maintaining
system stability.

Implement intelligent cache distribution and management across
tiers. This framework should optimize resource utilization while
maintaining required access speeds for different data categories.

### Implementation stepsa>

# LSPERF10-BP02 Establish intelligent cache warming and preloading based on clinical workflow patterns and seasonal variations

Develop predictive cache warming strategies that analyze historical
clinical access patterns to preload relevant reference data before
peak usage periods. Implement workflow-aware preloading for
scheduled procedures, seasonal health trends, and active clinical
trial requirements.

**Desired outcome:** Implement a
predictive cache management system that uses ML-driven historical
analysis for proactive data availability, adapts to workflow
patterns and seasonal demands, optimizes resource allocation based
on usage predictions, and provides consistent performance through
automated adjustments during varying demand periods.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Implement intelligent cache warming mechanisms based on historical
usage analysis. This foundation enables proactive data
availability while optimizing system performance during peak
periods.

Establish comprehensive monitoring of clinical access patterns and
workflows. This framework should identify and respond to regular
usage patterns while adapting to seasonal variations.

Deploy cache management systems that balance resource utilization
with access speed requirements. This provides optimal performance
during high-demand periods while maintaining efficient resource
usage.

Design adaptive caching strategies that account for predictable
variations in clinical workflows. This system should automatically
adjust to known seasonal patterns and usage trends.

Implement dynamic resource management that optimizes cache
allocation based on predicted demand. This improves the efficiency
of caching resources while maintaining performance levels.

### Implementation stepsa>

- Deploy ML-powered workflow monitoring and pattern analysis.
- Implement AI-driven predictive cache warming with automated
scheduling.
- Create adaptive workflow-aware caching with pattern
detection.
- Establish intelligent seasonal adjustment mechanisms.
- Deploy real-time cache performance optimization with AI.
- Implement automated efficiency monitoring and
recommendations.
