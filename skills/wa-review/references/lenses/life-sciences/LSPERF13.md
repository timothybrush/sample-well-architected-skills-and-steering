# LSPERF13-BP01 Conduct comprehensive site technology assessment and gap analysis

Begin with a thorough evaluation of the existing technological
infrastructure at each participating clinical site. Document
connectivity capabilities, bandwidth availability, network
reliability metrics, and adherence to healthcare standards. Identify
critical gaps through a standardized assessment protocol that
evaluates both technical capabilities and regulatory adherence.
Create a site-specific technology readiness scorecard that informs
network design and implementation requirements. This foundational
assessment tailors networking solutions to accommodate variability
across sites while meeting study requirements.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
comprehensive understanding of your network infrastructure across
trial sites with detailed visibility into traffic patterns and
bandwidth utilization. This enables informed decision-making for
network optimization and provides reliable connectivity for critical
trial operations.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Document and assess network infrastructure at each trial site,
including available bandwidth, current utilization patterns, and
existing bottlenecks. Evaluate various connectivity options such
as fiber, broadband, and cellular backup solutions. Create
comprehensive site profiles detailing redundancy requirements and
failover capabilities for critical locations for continuous trial
operations.

Analyze expected data volumes and traffic patterns for each trial
site, focusing on peak usage periods during different trial
phases. Document requirements for real-time data transmission,
considering critical trial activities and patient monitoring
needs. Create detailed mapping of data backup and synchronization
requirements to maintain data integrity across each location.

### Implementation steps

- Use AWS Systems Manager to maintain site inventory and
deploy Amazon CloudWatch agent for bandwidth monitoring.
- Deploy AWS Network Manager for connectivity assessments and
configure VPC Flow Logs for data volume analysis.
- Create a CloudWatch dashboard for comprehensive traffic
visualization and monitoring.
- Implement automated alerts for bandwidth thresholds and
network performance anomalies.
- Establish regular review cycles for network utilization
patterns and optimization opportunities.
- Document network topology and performance baselines to
support capacity planning.

# LSPERF13-BP02 Implement secure data exchange architecture with regulatory controls

Design a secure network architecture with data integrity and
cross-border regulatory adherence as priorities. Encrypt patient
data protection with robust key management. Implement standardized
secure protocols for data exchange that work across different
connectivity levels while meeting HIPAA, GDPR, and local healthcare
regulations. Set up data residency controls aligned with regional
health information requirements. Maintain comprehensive audit trails
for monitoring and quick incident response.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
secure data management system that enforces encryption standards,
meets regional regulatory requirements, and provides comprehensive
audit capabilities. This system protects sensitive trial data while
maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory adherence.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish comprehensive data security by defining classification
levels for different types of trial information. Implement robust
encryption standards protecting data both at rest and in transit
across trial locations. Develop key management procedures and
access control policies that align with trial security
requirements while providing for operational efficiency.

Create detailed documentation of healthcare regulations specific
to each Region where trials operate. Map HIPAA requirements
directly to network architecture and security controls. Identify
and implement data residency requirements for each jurisdiction,
and verify that you have proper data storage and transmission
paths. Establish comprehensive audit trail mechanisms that meet
regulatory standards.

Deploy comprehensive logging systems capturing relevant security
and operational events. Define critical monitoring parameters and
alert thresholds based on trial requirements and regulatory needs.
Establish regular review procedures to evaluate security posture
and adhere to regulatory requirements.

### Implementation steps

- Implement comprehensive encryption with AWS KMS for key
management, AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS, and AWS Secrets Manager for credential protection.
- Deploy tools including AWS Config for monitoring, AWS Control Tower for governance, and AWS Organizations for
centralized policy management.
- Secure data transfers using AWS Transfer Family for file
exchanges, AWS PrivateLink for service communication, and
AWS Direct Connect for dedicated connectivity.
- Establish robust security operations with AWS Systems Manager for automated responses, AWS Backup for data
recovery, and AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- Configure centralized logging and monitoring to detect
security anomalies and violations.
- Conduct regular security assessments and implement automated
remediation for identified vulnerabilities.
- Document security controls and maintain evidence of
adherence to regulatory requirements.

# LSPERF13-BP03 Deploy resilient connectivity with bandwidth optimization for remote locations

Set up multiple connectivity options based on each location's
geographic limitations and infrastructure. Use smart traffic
management to prioritize essential trial data transmission. Design
systems that work offline and sync automatically when connection
resumes, maintaining data integrity. Deploy backup options like
satellite, cellular, or mesh networks for locations with unreliable
connections. Use WAN optimization with compression and caching to
minimize bandwidth usage, especially in areas with limited
connectivity.

**Desired outcome:** You have a
resilient network infrastructure with redundant connectivity,
intelligent traffic prioritization, and robust offline capabilities.
This improves the continuity of your trial operations through
network disruptions while maintaining optimal performance for
critical data transfers and applications.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Deploy robust primary connections with reliable backup options to
provide continuous network availability. Implement automated
failover mechanisms that trigger when primary connections fail.
Set up comprehensive health monitoring systems to track connection
status and performance metrics, enabling proactive identification
of potential connectivity issues across trial locations.

Define and implement traffic prioritization based on critical data
flows essential for trial operations. Create quality of service
(QoS) policies that provide necessary bandwidth allocation to
high-priority trial data. Establish bandwidth rules that optimize
network resource utilization while maintaining performance for
critical applications and data transfers.

Develop local caching mechanisms to maintain operations during
connectivity interruptions. Implement robust data synchronization
protocols that maintain data consistency when connectivity is
restored. Create clear conflict resolution procedures to handle
data conflicts that may arise during offline operations,
maintaining data integrity across trial sites.

Implement advanced compression techniques to maximize available
bandwidth efficiency. Configure strategic caching mechanisms to
reduce redundant data transfers across the network. Establish
comprehensive monitoring systems to track optimization
effectiveness and identify areas for performance improvement.

### Implementation steps

- Establish resilient connectivity with AWS Direct Connect as
primary path, AWS Site-to-Site VPN for backup, and Amazon Route 53 for automated DNS failover.
- Optimize network architecture using AWS Transit Gateway for
centralized traffic management, AWS Global Accelerator for
performance, and VPC endpoints for secure service access.
- Implement content delivery and security with Amazon CloudFront for edge distribution and AWS WAF for
comprehensive traffic filtering and threat protection.
- Configure automated monitoring and alerting for connectivity
status, latency metrics, and security events across network
components.
- Document network topology with primary and backup paths,
including recovery procedures and escalation protocols.
- Conduct regular failover testing and performance
optimization to provide business continuity and an optimal
user experience.
