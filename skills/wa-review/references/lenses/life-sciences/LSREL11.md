# LSREL11-BP01 Implement monitoring of equipment telemetry to detect anomalies

Capture equipment telemetry such as temperature, vibration, cycle
counts, and error codes in real time to identify anomalies early. A
consistent telemetry pipeline enables proactive monitoring, alerts,
and traceability of equipment performance across research
facilities.

**Desired outcome:**

- Continuous monitoring of lab equipment to detect anomalies
early.
- Reduced risk of unplanned downtime through proactive alerts.
- Complete telemetry records available for troubleshooting and
audits.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Not collecting or collecting telemetry data inconsistently.
- Storing telemetry without time-stamping or contextual metadata.
- Failing to establish thresholds or alerts on critical
parameters.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Improves reliability of experiments through early detection of
issues.
- Enables root cause analysis and reproducibility through
equipment performance records.
- Supports regulatory adherence by providing traceable operational
logs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

A resilient telemetry strategy requires secure, standardized
pipelines for collection and long-term storage. Verify that your
data includes time stamps and contextual metadata to support
traceability. Integrate alerts with incident response processes
for timely remediation. Preserve telemetry records for audits and
long-term performance analysis.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy AWS IoT Greengrass to capture telemetry locally and
preprocess sensitive data at the lab site.
- Stream telemetry securely into AWS IoT Core for ingestion.
- Store data in Amazon Timestream for time-series analysis or
Amazon S3 for long-term archival.
- Configure anomaly detection with Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
and notify research operations teams through Amazon SNS.
- Provide researchers with performance dashboards using Quick for visualization.

- Incident detection and alerting
- Data integrity and traceability for regulated environments
- Root cause analysis frameworks

# LSREL11-BP02 Apply predictive maintenance using AI models

Use AI/ML models to analyze telemetry, usage logs, and maintenance
records for predicting potential equipment failures. Integrating
predictive insights with laboratory management systems reduces
downtime, optimize calibration schedules, and extend equipment life.

**Desired outcome:**

- Anticipation of failures before they occur, reducing experiment
disruption.
- Optimized maintenance schedules that balance reliability with
operational efficiency.
- Integration of predictive insights into research workflows and
logs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Relying solely on reactive maintenance after equipment fails.
- Collecting data but not training or updating predictive models.
- Not integrating predictive insights with LIMS or quality
systems, leading to disconnected records.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduces equipment failure rates and downtime.
- Extends equipment life cycles and optimized resource
utilization.
- Enhances regulatory adherence through integrated maintenance and
calibration logs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Predictive maintenance requires high-quality, centralized datasets
including logs, calibration records, and telemetry. Periodically
validate AI models to maintain trustworthiness in regulated
environments. Integrating outputs into research systems verifies
that predictions drive actionable workflows, rather than remaining
siloed in technical teams.

### Implementation steps

- Ingest telemetry into Amazon CloudWatch and usage logs into
Amazon S3.
- Train ML models in Amazon SageMaker AI using historical
performance datasets.
- For turnkey options, deploy Amazon Lookout for Equipment to
analyze telemetry streams.
- Integrate predictive alerts into Amazon EventBridge to
trigger workflows or incident responses.
- Store maintenance logs in Amazon RDS or integrate directly
with LIMS databases for traceability.

## Resources

**Related best practices:**

- AI/ML lifecycle management in regulated environments
- Integration of IT and OT (Operational Technology) systems
- GxP-aligned system validation for ML-driven processes

# LSREL11-BP03 Plan redundancy for critical laboratory equipment

Design redundancy strategies for critical laboratory equipment by
maintaining hot spares, parallelized runs, or vendor service
agreements. Effective redundancy maintains continuity of operations
even during failures of high-value or high-throughput instruments.

**Desired outcome:**

- Continuous operation of critical research workflows during
equipment failures.
- Reduced delays in experiments and studies by having spare
capacity.
- Documented continuity plans for audits and inspections.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Treating equipment equally without prioritizing critical
instruments.
- Failing to budget or plan for spare capacity in core systems.
- Assuming vendor maintenance SLAs are sufficient for continuity
of research operations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduces operational risk by maintaining continuity during
unexpected failures.
- Increases confidence in meeting research timelines and
commitments.
- Demonstrates resilience and preparedness to regulators and
auditors.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Start by classifying lab equipment by criticality and throughput
to identify which instruments require redundancy. Define
strategies such as hot spares, workload sharing, or vendor backup
agreements. Maintain documented runbooks for failover to redundant
equipment, and periodically simulate outages to test readiness.

### Implementation steps

- Track redundancy configurations using AWS Config for
reporting.
- Store redundancy plans, SLAs, and vendor contracts in Amazon S3, and enable fast search with Amazon OpenSearch Service.
- Orchestrate escalation procedures using Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda when failures are detected.
- Record continuity outcomes in Amazon DynamoDB for audit
traceability.
- Periodically simulate infrastructure and application-level
failures with AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) to
validate the continuity of data capture, workflow
orchestration, and failover processes supporting laboratory
equipment.
- For physical instruments, conduct tabletop or vendor-led
failure simulations to keep redundancy plans practical.

**Related best practices:**

- Business continuity and disaster recovery planning
- Risk-based classification of lab assets
- Vendor management and SLA governance
