# LSPERF04-BP01 Performance consistency through clinical trial lifetime

Design architectures with long-term performance stability as a
foundational principle, improving the consistency of system behavior
across the multi-year or multi-decade lifespan of clinical trials.
Implement forward-compatible data models, establish performance
baselines with comprehensive monitoring, and create governance
processes for managing technology transitions without disrupting
ongoing studies or compromising data integrity.

**Desired outcome:** Establish an
enduring architectural framework that maintains consistent
performance and data integrity across multi-year or multi-decade
clinical trial lifecycles.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

For long-term clinical trials, design your architectures with a
focus on maintaining consistent performance throughout extended
timeframes. Begin by implementing comprehensive data lifecycle
policies that strategically balance storage costs with query
performance requirements. As data ages, consider transitioning it
through storage tiers—from high-performance storage for active
analysis to more cost-effective archival solutions for data that
requires less frequent access but must remain retrievable for
auditing purposes.

Deploy infrastructure components using versioned infrastructure as
code (IaC) templates. This approach keeps your environments
reproducible even years later when regulatory audits may require
you to demonstrate the exact computational conditions under which
analyses were performed. Document dependencies thoroughly,
including specific library versions, container images, and
configuration parameters. Consider creating immutable snapshots of
complete environments at critical milestones.

Implement automated testing frameworks that can validate the
consistency of results across environment recreations. This
verifies that your infrastructure remains capable of reproducing
the same analytical outcomes over time, which is essential for
scientific validity and regulatory adherence. Additionally,
establish clear governance processes for managing changes to the
environment, which assists you in properly tracking, approving,
and validating modifications against baseline performance metrics.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy AWS CloudFormation templates for reproducible trials.
- Store clinical data in Amazon S3 with intelligent tiering.
- Monitor performance with Amazon CloudWatch custom
dashboards.
- Implement AWS Config rules for governance audits.
- Document system changes in AWS Systems Manager.
