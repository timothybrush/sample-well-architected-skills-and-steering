## Implementation guidance

Deploying latency-sensitive telco network workloads like Radio Access Network (RAN) and
user-plane nodes in edge locations is a crucial strategy for optimizing network performance
and improving user experience. By placing these components closer to the end users at the edge
of the network, telco operators can minimize latency and verify that critical services like
voice, video, and real-time data processing are delivered with low latency and high
responsiveness.

Edge computing solutions like AWS Wavelength and AWS Local Zones provide the infrastructure
to host these latency-sensitive telco workloads close to the end users. By leveraging these
services, telco operators can offload compute-intensive tasks to the edge, reducing the need
to backhaul traffic to centralized data centers and maintaining that end users experience the
best possible service.

When implementing this best practice, telco operators should carefully assess the
specific latency requirements of their services and the geographic distribution of their
customer base. This will inform the selection of appropriate edge locations and the workloads
that should be deployed at the edge versus in centralized data centers.

### Implementation steps

these workloads closer to the end users.
- Use Amazon EC2 instances in the selected AWS Wavelength Zones or AWS Local Zones to deploy
the identified latency-sensitive telco workloads, verifying they are optimized for
low-latency performance.
- Configure AWS Auto Scaling to automatically scale the EC2 instances hosting the
latency-sensitive workloads based on traffic patterns and resource utilization.

## Implementation guidance

Selecting the appropriate infrastructure regions for deploying telco workloads is crucial
for optimizing network performance and maintaining regulatory adherence. When choosing
regions, telco operators should consider several key factors:

- **Latency requirements:** For latency-sensitive applications like real-time voice and
video services, prioritize infrastructure regions that are geographically closer to the
end-user base to minimize latency. This may involve deploying certain workloads at the
network edge using services like AWS Wavelength or AWS Local Zones.
- **Data sovereignty and regulatory adherence:** Evaluate regional regulations regarding
data storage, processing, and retention, especially for customer information and call
records. Deploy workloads in regions that allow you to maintain adherence with local data
sovereignty laws.
- **Geographic distribution of customers:** Analyze the geographic distribution of your
customer base and align your infrastructure regions accordingly. This verifies that most
users can access telco services with optimal performance.

By strategically selecting infrastructure regions that balance latency, regulatory
adherence, and geographic coverage, telco operators can enhance service quality, reduce
latency, and maintain adherence to local regulations, improving the overall user experience
and operational efficiency of their services.

### Implementation steps

## Implementation guidance

Running the control plane nodes of a telco network in centralized geographical locations
is a strategic approach to meet the demands for high scalability and mobility. By
consolidating the control plane components in strategically placed data centers, telco
operators can achieve efficient resource management, load balancing, and fault tolerance
across the distributed system. This centralized control plane architecture allows the network
to better handle sudden traffic increases, support many client nodes, and provide reliable
failover mechanisms in case of individual node failures.

The control plane components, responsible for functions like authentication,
authorization, and mobility management, can be scaled more effectively in a centralized
deployment, maintaining that the overall network can adapt to changing demands and maintain
consistent service quality. Moreover, the centralized control plane design simplifies
operations and maintenance, as the critical functions are managed in a consolidated manner.
This approach enables telco operators to leverage advanced monitoring, automation, and
orchestration capabilities to optimize the performance and reliability of the control plane.

When implementing this best practice, telco operators should carefully select the
geographical locations for the control plane data centers, considering factors such as network
latency, data sovereignty, and disaster recovery planning. The control plane components should
be deployed with high availability and redundancy mechanisms to verify continuous operation
and seamless failover in case of infrastructure failures.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the key control plane components and functions within your telco network
architecture.
- Deploy the control plane components in centralized AWS Regions, using Amazon EC2
instances or Amazon EKS clusters to host the highly available and redundant control plane
infrastructure.
- Configure AWS Route 53 for DNS and service discovery, enabling efficient
communication between the control plane and user plane components.
- Implement Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the health, performance, and security
of the centralized control plane deployment.
- Set up AWS Lambda functions to automate the scaling, failover, and recovery
processes for the control plane components, maintaining efficient resource utilization
and rapid response to changes in demand.
- Regularly test the control plane failover and disaster recovery procedures using
AWS services like Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS Backup.
