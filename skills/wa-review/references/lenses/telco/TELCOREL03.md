# TELCOREL03-BP01 Use a controlled change management mechanism for software updates in production

Follow a controlled change management approach that blocks automatic updates in production
environments while maintaining changes are thoroughly tested in lower environments. This
includes establishing proper testing procedures, implementing structured change management, and
maintaining comprehensive rollback capabilities to minimize service disruption during system
updates.

**Desired outcome:**

- Minimized risk of service disruptions from updates.
- Validated changes before production deployment.
- Controlled deployment processes.
- Documented change procedures.
- Verified update effectiveness.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Prevent automatic software updates in production environments on the infrastructure and
network function levels. Implement a controlled change management process for the system and
service updates. Identify update mechanisms, configure update policies to disable automatic
updates while maintaining security adherence, and document detailed manual update procedures.
Establish comprehensive change control processes, including approval workflows, testing
requirements, and documentation standards. Maintain a centralized tracking system for updates
and develop robust rollback capabilities with automated and manual recovery procedures.
Continuously monitor the update process, define clear criteria for triggering rollbacks, and
validate the effectiveness of the recovery mechanisms.

### Implementation steps

- Disable automatic updates in production:

Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to manage and control operating system
and application updates across your AWS environment.
- Use AWS Config to monitor and audit the configuration of your systems,
including the update settings.

- Configure update policies:

Use AWS Config to define and enforce specific configurations for
disabling automatic updates while maintaining security.
- Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to centrally manage and store your
updated policies and configurations.

- Establish change controls:

Use AWS Config Rules to implement comprehensive change management processes,
including approval workflows, testing requirements, and documentation standards.
- Use AWS CloudTrail to track and audit update-related activities across your
AWS environment.

- Create a tracking system:

Use AWS Config to track and monitor update-related changes, including
pending updates, approved changes, and implementation status.
- Use Amazon DynamoDB to store update-related data and provide an audit trail
of activities.

- Maintain rollback procedures:

Use AWS Systems Manager Automation to design and implement the rollback
mechanisms, including both automated and manual rollback capabilities.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to establish the clear criteria for determining when
rollback procedures should be initiated, including both automated triggers and
manual decision points.
- Use AWS Config to verify the effectiveness of the rollback procedures by
validating system stability and functionality after rollback completion.

# TELCOREL03-BP02 Design a stateful, session-aware load balancing solution for cloud network functions (CNFs) to enable scaling and resilience

Cloud network functions (CNFs) such as AMF, SMF, and UPF in 5G architectures are typically
designed to be horizontally scalable. However, these components maintain subscriber session
state, and scaling events (up and down) can disrupt session continuity, leading to call drops,
session re-establishment delays, or degraded user experience. To address this challenge, it is
recommended to design a stateful, session-aware load balancing solution for CNFs that enables
seamless scaling and resilience. This can be achieved by collaborating with the CNF vendors and
relevant CNF communities to explore how cloud-based services can be adapted to support
seamless session handling.

**Desired outcome:**

- Provide a highly available and scalable load balancing solution that can maintain
session state for telco network functions deployed as cloud-based workloads.
- Verify seamless failover and state preservation during scaling events or instance
failures, minimizing service disruptions for end users.
- Enable efficient load distribution and resource utilization by intelligently routing
traffic based on current capacity and workload patterns.
- Integrate with Kubernetes-based deployment models and service abstractions used by
telco CNFs.
- Deliver carrier-grade performance and availability to meet the stringent requirements
of telco control plane and signaling workloads.

## Implementation guidance

Design a stateful load balancing architecture that maintains session state and seamless
failover, leveraging in-memory data stores or distributed databases to replicate session data
across instances. Integrate the load balancing solution with Kubernetes-based cloud-based
network functions, providing a standardized interface and allowing CNFs to configure load
balancing parameters. Implement a highly available and fault-tolerant design, with automated
failover and dynamic scaling capabilities. Enhance observability and monitoring to maintain
visibility into the load balancing system's performance, errors, and configuration changes.
Automate the deployment and lifecycle management of the load balancing solution to verify
consistency.

### Implementation steps

- Design a stateful load balancing architecture:

Use AWS application load balancing services, such as Application Load Balancer (ALB) and
Network Load Balancer (NLB), to handle the traffic routing and load distribution.
- Implement session stickiness and connection tracking mechanisms to maintain
session state and verify seamless failover.
- Utilize Amazon ElastiCache (For example, Redis) or Amazon DynamoDB to store and
replicate session data across the load balancing instances.

- Integrate with Kubernetes-based CNFs:

Develop a Kubernetes Ingress Controller or Gateway API implementation to
provide a standardized interface for telco CNFs to leverage the stateful load
balancing solution.
- Implement custom annotations or custom resource definitions (CRDs) to allow
telco CNFs to configure load balancing parameters, such as session timeouts and
stickiness.
- Verify the load balancing solution can discover and register telco CNF
instances through Kubernetes service discovery mechanisms.

- Optimize for carrier-grade performance:

Configure the load balancing instances to leverage high-performance AWS
instance types, such as C5 or M5 families, to handle the throughput and latency
requirements of telco workloads.
- Use AWS Nitro System-based instances for optimized networking and CPU
performance.
- Integrate with AWS Direct Connect and AWS Global Accelerator to provide low-latency connections
and Regional load distribution.

- Implement high availability and fault tolerance:

Deploy the load balancing solution across multiple AWS Availability Zones for
redundancy and resilience.
- Configure health checks, automated failover, and connection draining to verify
seamless failover during instance or Availability Zone failures.
- Leverage AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically scale the load balancing capacity based on
traffic patterns and resource utilization.

- Enhance observability and monitoring:

Integrate the load balancing solution with Amazon CloudWatch for comprehensive
monitoring of performance metrics, error rates, and health status.
- Implement Amazon CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to provide visibility into load
balancing behavior and trigger alerts for anomalies or potential issues.
- Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to track configuration changes and maintain an
audit trail of load balancing activities.

- Automate deployment and lifecycle management:

Package the load balancing solution as an AWS CloudFormation template or Terraform
configuration for consistent and repeatable deployment.
- Integrate the solution with AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild for automated CI/CD
workflows, including testing and deployment.
- Use AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager to manage the configuration of the load balancing
components and verify adherence with defined policies.
