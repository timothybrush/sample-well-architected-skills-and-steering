# TELCOSUS03-BP01 Adopt circular economy principles for telco network assets

Implementing circular economy principles in telco networks requires comprehensive
visibility into physical and virtual assets throughout their lifecycle. This includes tracking
network equipment from procurement through decommissioning, optimizing hardware utilization to
extend lifespan, and establishing processes for equipment refurbishment and responsible
recycling.

**Desired outcome**: Extend network equipment lifespan through
predictive maintenance, optimize asset utilization, and establish sustainable end-of-life
processes for hardware recycling and repurposing, reducing electronic waste and capital
expenditure.

**Benefits of establishing this practice:**

- Achieve reduction in equipment
replacement costs through lifecycle extension.
- Minimized electronic waste through reuse
and responsible recycling.
- Improved utilization rates through
better visibility.
- Meeting circular economy
regulations and corporate ESG commitments.
- Data-driven decisions on asset
replacement and maintenance.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Low

## Implementation guidance

Design an asset tracking system that monitors both physical infrastructure (base
stations, routers, switches) and virtual resources (VNF licenses, cloud resources). Use IoT
sensors to track equipment health metrics like temperature, power consumption, and performance
degradation to predict optimal replacement timing and identify reuse opportunities.

Implement predictive maintenance using machine learning to extend equipment lifespan. By
analyzing historical failure patterns and real-time telemetry, you can perform maintenance
before failures occur, reducing premature equipment replacement and minimizing electronic
waste.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy AWS IoT Core to connect and manage telco network equipment sensors, creating
digital twins for major assets like base stations and core network equipment.
- Configure AWS IoT SiteWise to model your telco asset hierarchy (regions, sites, equipment
types) and collect metrics on utilization, energy consumption, and health status.
- Implement Amazon Timestream to store time-series data from network equipment, enabling
long-term trend analysis for predictive maintenance.
- Create AWS IoT Events detectors to identify equipment approaching end-of-life based on
performance degradation patterns specific to telco equipment.
- Deploy Amazon SageMaker AI to build predictive maintenance models using historical failure
data.
- Set up Quick dashboards displaying asset utilization rates, predicted replacement
schedules, and opportunities for equipment redeployment.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager Inventory to track software licenses and virtual resource
allocation, identifying underutilized assets for reallocation.
- Configure Amazon SNS notifications for equipment lifecycle events (like warranty expiration,
maintenance due, and end-of-life) to enable proactive asset management.
