# SUS01-BP01 Choose Region based on both business requirements and sustainability goals

Choose a Region for your workload based on both your business requirements
and sustainability goals to optimize its KPIs, including performance, cost,
and carbon footprint.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You select the workload’s Region based on your own location.
- You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Placing a workload
close to Amazon renewable energy projects or Regions with low published carbon intensity can help
to lower the carbon footprint of a cloud workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

The AWS Cloud is a constantly expanding network of Regions and points of presence (PoP),
with a global network infrastructure linking them together. The choice of Region for your
workload significantly affects its KPIs, including performance, cost, and carbon footprint.
To effectively improve these KPIs, you should choose Regions for your workload based on
both your business requirements and sustainability goals.

### Implementation steps

- **Shortlist potential Regions:** Follow these steps to assess and shortlist potential Regions for your workload
based on your business requirements, including compliance, available features,
cost, and latency:

Confirm that these Regions are compliant, based on your required local regulations (for example, data sovereignty).
- Use the [AWS Regional Services Lists](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) to check if the Regions have the services and features you need to run your workload.
- Calculate the cost of the workload on each Region using the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
- Test the network latency between your end user locations and each AWS Region.

- **Choose Regions:** Choose Regions near Amazon renewable energy projects and Regions where the grid has a
published carbon intensity that is lower than other locations (or Regions).

Identify your relevant sustainability guidelines to track and compare year-to-year
carbon emissions based on [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) (market-based and location based methods).
- Choose region based on method you use to track carbon emissions. For more detail
