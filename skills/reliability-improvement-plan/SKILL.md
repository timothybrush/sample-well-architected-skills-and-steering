# Reliability Improvement Plan

## Step 1: Gather context

Ask the user:

> What workload would you like me to assess for reliability? Please share:
> - **Workload name** and code packages/directories to analyze
> - **Availability target** (99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%, etc.)
> - **Recovery objectives** (RTO and RPO if defined)
> - **Past incidents** (optional — recent outages or near-misses)

If context is already provided or you are in a codebase with IaC, proceed directly.

## Step 2: Fault Tolerance Discovery

Analyze infrastructure for single points of failure.

You MUST examine:
- Compute deployments (AZ distribution, instance count, ASG configs)
- Database configurations (Multi-AZ, read replicas, cluster topology)
- Cache configurations (cluster mode, replica counts, failover)
- Load balancer configurations (cross-zone, health checks, target groups)
- NAT Gateway placement (single vs per-AZ)
- DNS configurations (Route 53 health checks, failover routing)
- Queue and messaging configs (DLQ, redrive policies)
- Storage redundancy (S3 replication, EBS snapshots, EFS)

For each component, document:
- File path and line numbers
- Current redundancy level (single-AZ, multi-AZ, multi-region)
- Failure blast radius
- Failover mechanism (automatic, manual, none)

You MUST flag as HIGH RISK:
- Single-AZ database deployments for production workloads
- Compute without auto-scaling (fixed instance count)
- No health checks on load-balanced targets
- Single NAT Gateway serving multiple AZs
- Stateful services without replication
- Missing DLQ on async invocations (Lambda, SQS, EventBridge)
- No circuit breaker or timeout on external service calls

## Step 3: Recovery Capability Discovery

Analyze backup and recovery configurations.

You MUST examine:
- AWS Backup plans and rules
- RDS automated backup settings (retention, PITR)
- S3 versioning and replication rules
- DynamoDB PITR and backup settings
- EBS snapshot configurations
- Cross-region replication rules
- Disaster recovery configurations (pilot light, warm standby resources)

For each stateful resource, document:
- Backup frequency and retention
- Recovery point capability (RPO)
- Recovery time estimate (RTO)
- Whether recovery has been tested (look for DR runbooks, FIS experiments)

You MUST flag as HIGH RISK:
- Stateful resources with no backup configuration
- Backup retention < 7 days for production data
- No cross-region backup for critical data
- No evidence of recovery testing (no FIS experiments, no DR runbooks)

## Step 4: Scaling and Capacity Discovery

Analyze scaling and capacity configurations.

You MUST examine:
- Auto Scaling Group configurations (min, max, desired, scaling policies)
- ECS service scaling (target tracking, step scaling)
- Lambda concurrency settings (reserved, provisioned)
- DynamoDB capacity mode (on-demand vs provisioned, auto-scaling)
- SQS/Kinesis throughput configurations
- API Gateway throttling settings
- Service quota usage and alarms

You MUST flag as HIGH RISK:
- Compute without auto-scaling policies
- ASG with min = max (no scaling headroom)
- No service quota alarms
- Lambda without reserved concurrency on critical functions
- No load shedding or throttling for overload scenarios

## Step 5: Resilience Pattern Discovery

Analyze application code for resilience patterns.

You MUST examine:
- Retry configurations (SDK clients, custom retry logic)
- Timeout settings (HTTP clients, database connections, Lambda timeout)
- Circuit breaker implementations
- Fallback logic and graceful degradation patterns
- Idempotency handling (idempotency keys, deduplication)
- Health check endpoint implementations
- Connection pooling configurations

For each external integration, document:
- Timeout configured (or missing)
- Retry policy (exponential backoff, max attempts, jitter)
- Circuit breaker (present or absent)
- Fallback behavior on failure

You MUST flag as HIGH RISK:
- External service calls without timeouts
- No retry logic on SDK clients
- Missing idempotency on event-driven processing
- Health checks that don't verify actual functionality (shallow checks)
- Lambda timeout ≥ API Gateway timeout (will always timeout to caller)

## Step 6: Change Management Discovery

Analyze deployment safety configurations.

You MUST examine:
- Deployment strategies (canary, blue/green, rolling, all-at-once)
- Health check gating on deployments
- Automated rollback configurations (alarm-based)
- Database migration strategies (backward-compatible, blue/green schema)
- Feature flag usage

You MUST flag as HIGH RISK:
- All-at-once deployment to production
- No automated rollback on health check failure
- Database migrations that aren't backward-compatible
- No pre-production environment that mirrors production topology

---STOP---
**Checkpoint**: Discovery complete — present findings before evaluation.

> Here is what I discovered about your workload's reliability:
> - **Architecture**: {summary of components and dependencies}
> - **Single points of failure**: {count identified so far}
> - **Recovery capabilities**: {summary of backup/DR status}
>
> **Shall I proceed with the full reliability evaluation, or would you like to adjust scope?**

Do NOT proceed past this point until the user explicitly confirms.

## Step 7: Evaluate against WA Framework questions

For each question, provide: **Status**, **Evidence** (file:line), **Gaps**, **Risk**.

### REL 1 — How do you manage service quotas and constraints?
- Evidence: quota alarms, SDK retry configs, throttling handling code

### REL 2 — How do you plan your network topology?
- Evidence: subnet definitions, AZ distribution, NAT redundancy

## Step 8: Risk Assessment

For each finding, assess using Impact × Likelihood:

**Impact**: Minor (brief degradation, automatic recovery) | Moderate (extended outage for subset of users, manual intervention needed) | Severe (full outage, data loss, cannot recover within RTO)

**Likelihood**: Low (requires multiple simultaneous failures) | Medium (single component failure could trigger) | High (normal operational event could trigger, no redundancy)

| Impact   | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Severe   | High       | Critical   |
| Severe   | Medium     | High       |
| Severe   | Low        | High       |
| Moderate | High       | High       |
| Moderate | Medium     | Medium     |
| Moderate | Low        | Medium     |
| Minor    | High       | Medium     |
| Minor    | Medium     | Low        |
| Minor    | Low        | Low        |

---STOP---
**Checkpoint**: Assessment complete — confirm findings before generating remediation plan.

> Assessment summary:
> - **Critical findings**: {count}
> - **High findings**: {count}
> - **Medium/Low findings**: {count}
>
> **Shall I produce the full remediation plan, or would you like to discuss specific findings first?**

Do NOT proceed past this point until the user explicitly confirms.

## Step 10: Offer follow-up

After delivering the plan, offer:

> Would you like me to:
> - Design multi-AZ architecture for a specific component?
> - Generate FIS experiment templates for chaos engineering?
> - Implement circuit breaker patterns for service dependencies?
> - Create backup and DR IaC for stateful resources?
> - Design a deployment safety configuration with automated rollback?

## Calibration Guidance

- A workload with Multi-AZ, auto-scaling, health checks, automated rollback, and backups is MATURE — focus on advanced testing (chaos engineering, DR drills, game days)
- Every finding MUST have code evidence — don't flag "missing Multi-AZ" without checking the IaC
- For data pipelines: prioritize data durability over compute availability — message loss is worse than processing delay
- Match expectations to availability target: 99.9% doesn't require multi-region, 99.99% does
- "Cannot Determine" is valid for operational aspects not visible in code (e.g., whether DR drills are actually run)
- Acknowledge existing reliability patterns prominently before listing gaps
