# REL10-BP01 Deploy the workload to multiple locations

Distribute workload data and resources across multiple Availability
Zones or, where necessary, across AWS Regions.

A fundamental principle for service design in AWS is to avoid single
points of failure, including the underlying physical infrastructure.
AWS provides cloud computing resources and services globally across
multiple geographic locations called
[Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/regions.html).
Each Region is physically and logically independent and consists of
three or more
[Availability
Zones (AZs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/availability-zones.html). Availability Zones are geographically close to
each other but are physically separated and isolated. When you
distribute your workloads among Availability Zones and Regions, you
mitigate the risk of threats such as fires, floods, weather-related
disasters, earthquakes, and human error.

Create a location strategy to provide high availability that is
appropriate for your workloads.

**Desired outcome:** Production
workloads are distributed among multiple Availability Zones (AZs) or
Regions to achieve fault tolerance and high availability.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Your production workload exists only in a single Availability
Zone.
- You implement a multi-Region architecture when a multi-AZ
architecture would satisfy business requirements.
- Your deployments or data become desynchronized, which results in
configuration drift or under-replicated data.
- You don't account for dependencies between application
components if resilience and multi-location requirements differ
between those components.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Your workload is more resilient to incidents, such as power or
environmental control failures, natural disasters, upstream
service failures, or network issues that impact an AZ or an
entire Region.
- You can access a wider inventory of Amazon EC2 instances and
reduce the likelihood of
InsufficientCapacityExceptions (ICE) when
launching specific EC2 instance types.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Deploy and operate all production workloads in at least two
Availability Zones (AZs) in a Region.

**Using multiple Availability
Zones**

Availability Zones are resource hosting locations that are
physically separated from each other to avoid correlated failures
due to risks such as fires, floods, and tornadoes. Each
Availability Zone has independent physical infrastructure,
including utility power connections, backup power sources,
mechanical services, and network connectivity. This arrangement
limits faults in any of these components to just the impacted
Availability Zone. For example, if an AZ-wide incident makes EC2
instances unavailable in the affected Availability Zone, your
instances in other Availability Zone remains available.

Despite being physically separated, Availability Zones in the same
AWS Region are close enough to provide high-throughput,
low-latency (single-digit millisecond) networking. You can
replicate data synchronously between Availability Zones for most
workloads without significantly impacting user experience. This
means you can use Availability Zones in a Region in an
active/active or active/standby configuration.

All compute associated with your workload should be distributed
among multiple Availability Zones. This includes
[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
instances, [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) tasks, and VPC-attached
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. AWS compute services, including
[EC2
Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/),
[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), and
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), provide ways for you to launch
and manage compute across Availability Zones. Configure them to
automatically replace compute as needed in a different
Availability Zone to maintain availability. To direct traffic to
available Availability Zones, place a load balancer in front of
your compute, such as an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
Balancer. AWS load balancers can reroute traffic to available
instances in the event of an Availability Zone impairment.

You should also replicate data for your workload and make it
available in multiple Availability Zones. Some AWS managed data
services, such as
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Amazon Elastic File
Service (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/),
[Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/aurora/),
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/),
[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), and
[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/) replicate data in multiple
Availability Zones by default and are robust against Availability
Zone impairment. With other AWS managed data services, such as
[Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/),
[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), and
[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), you must enable multi-AZ replication. Once
enabled, these services automatically detect an Availability Zone
impairment, redirect requests to an available Availability Zone,
and re-replicate data as needed after recovery without customer
intervention. Familiarize yourself with the user guide for each
AWS managed data service you use to understand its multi-AZ
capabilities, behaviors, and operations.

If you are using self-managed storage, such as
[Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) volumes or Amazon EC2 instance storage,
you must manage multi-AZ replication yourself.

*Figure 9: Multi-tier architecture deployed across three
Availability Zones. Note that Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB are
always Multi-AZ automatically. The ELB also is deployed to all three
zones.*

**Using multiple AWS Regions**

If you have workloads that require extreme resilience (such as
critical infrastructure, health-related applications, or services
with stringent customer or mandated availability requirements),
you may require additional availability beyond what a single AWS Region can provide. In this case, you should deploy and operate
your workload across at least two AWS Regions (assuming that your
data residency requirements allow it).

AWS Regions are located in different geographical regions around
the world and in multiple continents. AWS Regions have even
greater physical separation and isolation than Availability
Zones alone. AWS services, with few exceptions, take advantage of
this design to operate fully independently between different
Regions (also known as *Regional services*). A
failure of an AWS Regional service is designed not to impact the
service in a different Region.

When you operate your workload in multiple Regions, you should
consider additional requirements. Because resources in different
Regions are separate from and independent of one another, you must
duplicate your workload's components in each Region. This includes
foundational infrastructure, such as VPCs, in addition to compute
and data services.

**NOTE:** When you consider a
multi-Regional design, verify that your workload is capable of
running in a single Region. If you create dependencies between
Regions where a component in one Region relies on services or
components in a different Region, you can increase the risk of
failure and significantly weaken your reliability posture.

To ease multi-Regional deployments and maintain consistency,
[AWS CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) can replicate your entire AWS
infrastructure across multiple Regions.
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) can also detect configuration drift and
inform you when your AWS resources in a Region are out of sync.
Many AWS services offer multi-region replication for important
workload assets. For example,
[EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) can publish your EC2 machine images (AMIs) after
every build to each Region you use.
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) can replicate your container
images to your selected Regions.

You must also replicate your data across each of your chosen
Regions. Many AWS managed data services provide cross-Regional
replication capability, including Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB,
Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticache,
and Amazon EFS.
[Amazon DynamoDB global tables](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/) accept writes in any supported
Region and will replicate data among all your other configured
Regions. With other services, you must designate a primary Region
for writes, as other Regions contain read-only replicas. For each
AWS-managed data service your workload uses, refer to its user
guide and developer guide to understand its multi-Region
capabilities and limitations. Pay special attention to where
writes must be directed, transactional capabilities and
limitations, how replication is performed, and how to monitor
synchronization between Regions.

AWS also provides the ability to route request traffic to your
Regional deployments with great flexibility. For example, you can
configure your DNS records using
[Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to direct traffic to the closest available Region to the
user. Alternatively, you can configure your DNS records in an
active/standby configuration, where you designate one Region as
primary and fall back to a Regional replica only if the primary
Region becomes unhealthy. You can configure
[Route 53 health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route%C2%A053/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html) to detect unhealthy endpoints and perform
automatic failover and additionally use
[Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/) to provide a
highly-available routing control for manually re-routing traffic
as needed.

Even if you choose not to operate in multiple Regions for high
availability, consider multiple Regions as part of your disaster
recovery (DR) strategy. If possible, replicate your workload's
infrastructure components and data in a *warm
standby* or *pilot light*
configuration in a secondary Region. In this design, you replicate
baseline infrastructure from the primary Region such as VPCs, Auto
Scaling groups, container orchestrators, and other components, but
you configure the variable-sized components in the standby Region
(such as the number of EC2 instances and database replicas) to be
a minimally-operable size. You also arrange for continuous data
replication from the primary Region to the standby Region. If an
incident occurs, you can then scale out, or grow, the resources in
the standby Region, and then promote it to become the primary
Region.

### Implementation steps

- Work with business stakeholders and data residency experts
to determine which AWS Regions can be used to host your
resources and data.
- Work with business and technical stakeholders to evaluate
your workload, and determine whether its resilience needs
can be met by a multi-AZ approach (single AWS Region) or if
they require a multi-Region approach (if multiple Regions
are permitted). The use of multiple Regions can achieve
greater availability but can involve additional complexity
and cost. Consider the following factors in your evaluation:

**Business objectives and customer
requirements**: How much downtime is permitted
should a workload-impacting incident occur in an
Availability Zone or a Region? Evaluate your recovery
point objectives as discussed in
[REL13-BP01
Define recovery objectives for downtime and data
loss](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html).
- **Disaster recovery (DR)
requirements**: What kind of potential disaster
do you want to insure yourself against? Consider the
possibility of data loss or long-term unavailability at
different scopes of impact from a single Availability
Zone to an entire Region. If you replicate data and
resources across Availability Zones, and a single
Availability Zone experiences a sustained failure, you
can recover service in another Availability Zone. If you
replicate data and resources across Regions, you can
recover service in another Region.

- Deploy your compute resources into multiple Availability
Zones.

In your VPC, create multiple subnets in different
Availability Zones. Configure each to be large enough to
accommodate the resources needed to serve the workload,
even during an incident. For more detail, see
[REL02-BP03
Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and
availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_network_topology_ip_subnet_allocation.html).
- If you are using Amazon EC2 instances, use
[EC2
Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) to manage your instances. Specify
the subnets you chose in the previous step when you
create your Auto Scaling groups.
- If you are using AWS Fargate compute for
[Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) or
[Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html), select the subnets you chose in the first
step when you create an ECS Service, launch an ECS task,
or create a
[Fargate
profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) for EKS.
- If you are using AWS Lambda functions that need to run
in your VPC, select the subnets you chose in the first
step when you create the Lambda function. For any
functions that do not have a VPC configuration, AWS Lambda manages availability for you automatically.
- Place traffic directors such as load balancers in front
of your compute resources. If cross-zone load balancing
is enabled,
[AWS Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) and
[Network
Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) detect when targets such as EC2
instances and containers are unreachable due to
Availability Zone impairment and reroute traffic towards
targets in healthy Availability Zones. If you disable
cross-zone load balancing, use Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) to provide zonal
shift capability. If you are using a third-party load
balancer or have implemented your own load balancers,
configure them with multiple front ends across different
Availability Zones.

- Replicate your workload's data across multiple Availability
Zones.

If you use an AWS-managed data service such as Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, or Amazon FSx, study its user
guide to understand its data replication and resilience
capabilities. Enable cross-AZ replication and failover
if necessary.
- If you use AWS-managed storage services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx, avoid using single-AZ or
One Zone configurations for data that requires high
durability. Use a multi-AZ configuration for these
services. Check the respective service's user guide to
determine whether multi-AZ replication is enabled by
default or whether you must enable it.
- If you run a self-managed database, queue, or other
storage service, arrange for multi-AZ replication
according to the application's instructions or best
practices. Familiarize yourself with the failover
procedures for your application.

- Configure your DNS service to detect AZ impairment and
reroute traffic to a healthy Availability Zone. Amazon Route 53, when used in combination with Elastic Load Balancers,
can do this automatically. Route 53 can also be configured
with failover records that use health checks to respond to
queries with only healthy IP addresses. For any DNS records
used for failover, specify a short time to live (TTL) value
(for example, 60 seconds or less) to help prevent record
caching from impeding recovery (Route 53 alias records
supply appropriate TTLs for you).

**Additional steps when using multiple AWS Regions**

- Replicate all operating system (OS) and application code
used by your workload across your selected Regions.
Replicate Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used by your EC2
instances if necessary using solutions such as Amazon EC2
Image Builder. Replicate container images stored in
registries using solutions such as Amazon ECR cross-Region
replication. Enable Regional replication for any Amazon S3
buckets used for storing application resources.
- Deploy your compute resources and configuration metadata
(such as parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter
Store) into multiple Regions. Use the same procedures
described in previous steps, but replicate the configuration
for each Region you are using for your workload. Use
infrastructure as code solutions such as AWS CloudFormation
to uniformly reproduce the configurations among Regions. If
you are using a secondary Region in a pilot light
configuration for disaster recovery, you may reduce the
number of your compute resources to a minimum value to save
cost, with a corresponding increase in time to recovery.
- Replicate your data from your primary Region into your
secondary Regions.

Amazon DynamoDB global tables provide global replicas of
your data that can be written to from any supported
Region. With other AWS-managed data services, such as
Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, and Amazon Elasticache, you
designate a primary (read/write) Region and replica
(read-only) Regions. Consult the respective services'
user and developer guides for details on Regional
replication.
- If you are running a self-managed database, arrange for
multi-Region replication according to the application's
instructions or best practices. Familiarize yourself
with the failover procedures for your application.
- If your workload uses AWS EventBridge, you may need to
forward selected events from your primary Region to your
secondary Regions. To do so, specify event buses in your
secondary Regions as targets for matched events in your
primary Region.

- Consider whether and to what extent you want to use
identical encryption keys across Regions. A typical approach
that balances security and ease of use is to use
Region-scoped keys for Region-local data and authentication,
and use globally-scoped keys for encryption of data that is
replicated among different Regions.
[AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) supports
[multi-region
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) to securely distribute and protect keys shared
across Regions.
- Consider AWS Global Accelerator to improve the availability
of your application by directing traffic to Regions that
contain healthy endpoints.

# REL10-BP02 Automate recovery for components constrained to a single location

If components of the workload can only run in a single Availability Zone or in an on-premises data center, implement the capability to do a complete rebuild of the workload within your defined recovery objectives.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

If the best practice to deploy the workload to multiple locations is
not possible due to technological constraints, you must implement an
alternate path to resiliency. You must automate the ability to
recreate necessary infrastructure, redeploy applications, and
recreate necessary data for these cases.

For example, Amazon EMR launches all nodes for a given cluster in
the same Availability Zone because running a cluster in the same
zone improves performance of the jobs flows as it provides a higher
data access rate. If this component is required for workload
resilience, then you must have a way to redeploy the cluster and its
data. Also for Amazon EMR, you should provision redundancy in ways
other than using Multi-AZ. You can
provision [multiple
nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-ha-launch.html).
Using [EMR
File System (EMRFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html), data in EMR can be stored in Amazon S3,
which in turn can be replicated across multiple Availability Zones
or AWS Regions.

Similarly, for Amazon Redshift, by default it provisions your
cluster in a randomly selected Availability Zone within the AWS Region that you select. All the cluster nodes are provisioned in the
same zone.

For stateful server-based workloads deployed to an on-premise data center, you can use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery to protect your workloads in AWS. If you are already hosted in AWS, you can use Elastic Disaster Recovery to protect your workload to an alternative Availability Zone or Region. Elastic Disaster Recovery uses continual block-level replication to a lightweight staging area to provide fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications.

**Implementation steps**

- Implement self-healing. Deploy your instances or containers using
automatic scaling when possible. If you cannot use automatic
scaling, use automatic recovery for EC2 instances or implement
self-healing automation based on Amazon EC2 or ECS container
lifecycle events.

Use [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) for instances and container workloads that have no
requirements for a single instance IP address, private IP address, Elastic IP address,
and instance metadata.

The launch template user data can be used to implement automation that can self-heal most workloads.

- Use automatic [recovery of Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html) for workloads that require a single
instance ID address, private IP address, elastic IP address, and instance metadata.

Automatic Recovery will send recovery status alerts to a SNS topic as the
instance failure is detected.

- Use [Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) or [Amazon ECS events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_cwe_events.html) to automate self-healing where
automatic scaling or EC2 recovery cannot be used.

Use the events to invoke automation that will heal your component
according to the process logic you require.

- Protect stateful workloads that are limited to a single location using [AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/what-is-drs.html).

# REL10-BP03 Use bulkhead architectures to limit scope of impact

Implement bulkhead architectures (also known as cell-based architectures) to restrict the effect of failure within a workload to a limited number of components.

**Desired outcome:** A cell-based architecture uses multiple isolated instances of a workload, where each instance is known as a cell. Each cell is independent, does not share state with other cells, and handles a subset of the overall workload requests. This reduces the potential impact of a failure, such as a bad software update, to an individual cell and the requests it is processing. If a workload uses 10 cells to service 100 requests, when a failure occurs, 90% of the overall requests would be unaffected by the failure.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Allowing cells to grow without bounds.
- Applying code updates or deployments to all cells at the same time.
- Sharing state or components between cells (with the exception of the router layer).
- Adding complex business or routing logic to the router layer.
- Not minimizing cross-cell interactions.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** With cell-based architectures, many common types of failure are contained within the cell itself, providing additional fault isolation. These fault boundaries can provide resilience against failure types that otherwise are hard to contain, such as unsuccessful code deployments or requests that are corrupted or invoke a specific failure mode (also known as *poison pill requests*).

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

On a ship, bulkheads ensure that a hull breach is contained within one section of the hull. In complex systems, this pattern is often replicated to allow fault isolation. Fault isolated boundaries restrict the effect of a failure within a workload to a limited number of components. Components outside of the boundary are unaffected by the failure. Using multiple fault isolated boundaries, you can limit the impact on your workload. On AWS, customers can use multiple Availability Zones and Regions to provide fault isolation, but the concept of fault isolation can be extended to your workload’s architecture as well.

The overall workload is partitioned cells by a partition key. This key needs to align with the *grain* of the service, or the natural way that a service's workload can be subdivided with minimal cross-cell interactions. Examples of partition keys are customer ID, resource ID, or any other parameter easily accessible in most API calls. A cell routing layer distributes requests to individual cells based on the partition key and presents a single endpoint to clients.

*Figure 11: Cell-based architecture*

**Implementation steps**

When designing a cell-based architecture, there are several design considerations to consider:

- **Partition key**: Special consideration should be taken
while choosing the partition key.

It should align with the grain of the service, or the natural way that a service's workload can be subdivided with minimal cross-cell interactions. Examples are `customer ID` or `resource ID`.
- The partition key must be available in all requests, either directly or in a way that could be easily inferred deterministically by other parameters.

- **Persistent cell mapping**: Upstream services should only
interact with a single cell for the lifecycle of their resources.

Depending on the workload, a cell migration strategy may be needed to migrate data from one cell to another. A possible scenario when a cell migration may be needed is if a particular user or resource in your workload becomes too big and requires it to have a dedicated cell.
- Cells should not share state or components between cells.
- Consequently, cross-cell interactions should be avoided or kept to a minimum, as those interactions create dependencies between cells and therefore diminish the fault isolation improvements.

- **Router layer**: The router layer is a shared component
between cells, and therefore cannot follow the same compartmentalization strategy as with
cells.

It is recommended for the router layer to distribute requests to individual cells using a partition mapping algorithm in a computationally efficient manner, such as combining cryptographic hash functions and modular arithmetic to map partition keys to cells.
- To avoid multi-cell impacts, the routing layer must remain as simple and horizontally scalable as possible, which necessitates avoiding complex business logic within this layer. This has the added benefit of making it easy to understand its expected behavior at all times, allowing for thorough testability. As explained by Colm MacCárthaigh in [Reliability, constant work, and a good cup of coffee](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/reliability-and-constant-work/), simple designs and constant work patterns produce reliable systems and reduce anti-fragility.

- **Cell size**: Cells should have a maximum size and should
not be allowed to grow beyond it.

The maximum size should be identified by performing thorough testing, until breaking points are reached and safe operating margins are established. For more detail on how to implement testing practices, see [REL07-BP04 Load test your workload](./rel_adapt_to_changes_load_tested_adapt.html)
- The overall workload should grow by adding additional cells, allowing the workload to scale with increases in demand.

- **Multi-AZ or Multi-Region strategies**: Multiple layers of
resilience should be leveraged to protect against different failure domains.

For resilience, you should use an approach that builds layers of defense. One layer protects against smaller, more common disruptions by building a highly available architecture using multiple AZs. Another layer of defense is meant to protect against rare events like widespread natural disasters and Region-level disruptions. This second layer involves architecting your application to span multiple AWS Regions. Implementing a multi-Region strategy for your workload helps protect it against widespread natural disasters that affect a large geographic region of a country, or technical failures of Region-wide scope. Be aware that implementing a multi-Region architecture can be significantly complex, and is usually not required for most workloads. For more detail, see [REL10-BP01 Deploy the workload to multiple locations](./rel_fault_isolation_multiaz_region_system.html).

- **Code deployment**: A staggered code deployment strategy
should be preferred over deploying code changes to all cells at the same time.

This helps minimize potential failure to multiple cells due to a bad deployment or human error. For more detail, see [Automating safe, hands-off deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/).
