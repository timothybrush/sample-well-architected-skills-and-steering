# COST11-BP01 Perform automation for operations

Evaluate the operational costs on the cloud, focusing on
quantifying the time and effort savings in administrative tasks,
deployments, mitigating the risk of human errors, compliance, and
other operations through automation. Assess the time and associated
costs required for operational efforts and implement automation for
administrative tasks to minimize manual effort wherever
feasible.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Automating operations reduces the frequency of manual tasks,
improves efficiency, and benefits customers by delivering a
consistent and reliable experience when deploying, administering,
or operating workloads. You can free up infrastructure resources
from manual operational tasks and use them for higher value tasks
and innovations, which improves business value. Enterprises
require a proven, tested way to manage their workloads in the
cloud. That solution must be secure, fast, and cost effective,
with minimum risk and maximum reliability.

Start by prioritizing your operational activities based on
required effort by looking at overall operations cost. For
example, how long does it take to deploy new resources in the
cloud, make optimization changes to existing ones, or implement
necessary configurations? Look at the total cost of human actions
by factoring in cost of operations and management. Prioritize
automations for admin tasks to reduce the human effort.

Review effort should reflect the potential benefit. For example,
examine time spent performing tasks manually as opposed to
automatically. Prioritize automating repetitive, high value, time
consuming and complex activities. Activities that pose a high
value or high risk of human error are typically the better place
to start automating as the risk often poses an unwanted additional
operational cost (like operations team working extra hours).

Use automation tools like AWS Systems Manager or AWS Config to
streamline operations, compliance, monitoring, lifecycle, and
termination processes. With AWS services, tools, and third-party
products, you can customize the automations you implement to meet
your specific requirement. Following table shows some of the core
operation functions and capabilities you can achieve with AWS
services to automate administration and operation:

- [AWS Audit Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/): Continually audit your AWS usage to
simplify risk and compliance assessment
- [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/): Centrally manage and automate data protection.
- [AWS Config:](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) Configure compute resources, asses, audit,
evaluate configurations and resource inventory.
- [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/): Launch highly available resources with
Infrastructure as Code.
- [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/): IT change management,
compliance, and control.
- [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) Schedule events and trigger AWS Lambda to
take action.
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Automate repetitive processes by triggering
them with events or by running them on a fixed schedule with
AWS EventBridge.
- [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/): Start and stop workloads, patch
operating systems, automate configuration, and ongoing
management.
- [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/): Schedule jobs and automate workflows.
- [AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/): Template consumption,
infrastructure as code with compliance and control.

If you would like to adopt automations immediately by using AWS
products and service and if don't have skills in your
organization, reach out to
[AWS Managed Services (AMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-services/),

[AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/), or

[AWS Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/work-with-partners/?nc2=h_ql_pa_wwap_cp) to increase adoption of automation and improve
your operational excellence in the cloud.

AWS Managed Services (AMS) is a service that operates AWS
infrastructure on behalf of enterprise customers and partners. It
provides a secure and compliant environment that you can deploy
your workloads onto. AMS uses enterprise cloud operating models
with automation to allow you to meet your organization
requirements, move into the cloud faster, and reduce your on-going
management costs.

AWS Professional Services can also help you achieve your desired
business outcomes and automate operations with AWS. They help
customers to deploy automated, robust, agile IT operations, and
governance capabilities optimized for the cloud. For detailed
monitoring examples and recommended best practices, see
Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper.

### Implementation steps

- **Build once and deploy
many**: Use infrastructure-as-code such as
CloudFormation, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI to deploy once and use
many times for similar environments or for disaster recovery
scenarios. Tag while deploying to track your consumption as
defined in other best practices. Use
[AWS Launch Wizard](https://aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/) to reduce the time to deploy many
popular enterprise workloads. AWS Launch Wizard guides you
through the sizing, configuration, and deployment of
enterprise workloads following AWS best practices. You can
also use the
[Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/), which helps you create and manage
infrastructure-as-code approved templates for use on AWS so
anyone can discover approved, self-service cloud resources.
- **Automate continuous
compliance:** Consider automating assessment and
remediation of recorded configurations against predefined
standards. When you combine AWS Organizations with the
capabilities of AWS Config
and [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), you can efficiently manage and
automate configuration compliance at scale for hundreds of
member accounts. You can review changes in configurations
and relationships between AWS resources and dive into the
history of a resource configuration.
- **Automate monitoring tasks**
AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor
services. You can configure these tools to automate
monitoring tasks. Create and implement a monitoring plan
that collects monitoring data from all the parts in your
workload so that you can more easily debug a multi-point
failure if one occurs. For example, you can use the
automated monitoring tools to observe Amazon EC2 and report
back to you when something is wrong for system status
checks, instance status checks, and Amazon CloudWatch
alarms.
- **Automate maintenance and
operations**: Run routine operations automatically
without human intervention. Using AWS services and tools,
you can choose which AWS automations to implement and
customize for your specific requirements. For example, use
[EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) for building, testing, and deployment
of virtual machine and container images for use on AWS or
on-premises or patching your EC2 instances with AWS SSM. If
your desired action cannot be done with AWS services or you
need more complex actions with filtering resources, then
automate your operations by using
[AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) (AWS CLI) or AWS SDK tools.
AWS CLI provides the ability to automate the entire process
of controlling and managing AWS services with scripts without
using the AWS Management Console. Select your preferred AWS SDKs to
interact with AWS services. For other code examples,
see AWS SDK Code
[examples
repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples).
- **Create a continual lifecycle with
automations:** It is important that you establish
and preserve mature lifecycle policies not only for
regulations or redundancy but also for cost optimization.
You can use AWS Backup to centrally manage and automate data
protection of data stores, such as your buckets, volumes,
databases, and file systems. You can also use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation, retention, and
deletion of EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs.
- **Delete unnecessary
resources:** It's quite common to accumulate unused
resources in sandbox or development AWS accounts. Developers
create and experiment with various services and resources as
part of the normal development cycle, and then they don't
delete those resources when they're no longer needed. Unused
resources can incur unnecessary and sometimes high costs for
the organization. Deleting these resources can reduce the
costs of operating these environments. Make sure your data
is not needed or backed up if you are not sure. You can use
AWS CloudFormation to clean up deployed stacks, which
automatically deletes most resources defined in the
template. Alternatively, you can create an automation for
the deletion of AWS resources using tools like
[aws-nuke](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/automate-deletion-of-aws-resources-by-using-aws-nuke.html).
