# [AG.SAD.4] Limit human access with just-in-time access

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

As pipelines take on a more prominent role in the software
development lifecycle in a DevOps model, the necessity for
extensive human access to environments decreases. Human users
should be granted minimal access necessary for their role,
which is usually read-only access that does not allow any
modifications or access to sensitive data. For experimentation
which is typically hands-on and exploratory, teams should be
granted access to sandbox environments which are isolated from
system workloads.

In some cases, where things go wrong or a process cannot yet be automated, elevated
permissions might be required. To accommodate these needs without compromising security,
implement a just-in-time (JIT) access control strategy where permissions are temporarily
escalated for a specific duration and purpose, upon explicit request and approval. This
approach maintains the principle of least privilege, allowing necessary operational
functions to be performed efficiently when needed, while also ensuring that the access is
revoked once the task is complete.

By enforcing limited human permissions and using JIT access, you can improve your
organization's security posture and reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of
access rights. This restrictive and controlled model supports modern, secure DevOps
practices where pipelines, treating everything as code, and automation should take
precedence over manual actions.
