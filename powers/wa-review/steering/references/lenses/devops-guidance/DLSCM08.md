# [DL.SCM.8] Use a versioning specification to manage software components

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Apply a versioning specification across all software
components within your development lifecycle. Use a versioning
specification, such as Semantic Versioning (SemVer), to
significantly simplify governance of software governance by
providing a systematic approach to tracking different types of
releases (major, minor, and patch). A well-organized,
versioned code base offers a clear chronological history of
modifications, enhancing manageability, maintainability, and
navigability.

Implementing version pinning for dependencies is a practical use case enabled by
using a versioning specification. By locking dependencies to a specific version or version
range, build reproducibility is ensured. This approach helps ensure the reproducibility of
software builds, but complicates dependency management as developers then need to make
updates to stay up-to-date with security fixes, bug fixes, or other improvements.

Use automated governance dependency management tools to maintain the balance between
stable builds and timely updates. Consider integrating automation mechanisms that can
update versions based on commit messages. For example, if a commit message contains the
keyword `major`, it could trigger an update to the major version number. This
automated approach ensures that versions are updated while minimizing chance for human
error.  It's also possible to automate nightly or weekly upgrades of third-party
dependencies to ensure they are regularly updated and kept secure.
