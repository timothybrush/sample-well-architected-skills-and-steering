# [DL.CS.4] Enhance traceability using commit signing

**Category:** OPTIONAL

Commit signing involves attaching a digital signature to code
commits, certifying the integrity of changes and the identity
of the committer. While not universally adopted by all
organizations, commit signing enhances trust and traceability
as developers make code changes, making it easier to track the
origin of changes and ensure their authenticity.

Have developers sign their code changes when submitting to
version control using personal private keys from tools
like [GPG](https://gnupg.org/).
Developers should be encouraged to sign both commits and tags
with their private keys. This can be particularly valuable for
open-source projects or where code originates from diverse
sources.

For this approach to be effective in practice, developers require an understanding of
certificates and using them for signing. Developers must ensure that their private keys
remain confidential, taking measures to store them securely and avoid potential
exposure. They also should be trained to recognize signs of key compromise, such as
unexpected commits. When compromise is detected, the associated key should be revoked
immediately to mitigate potential risks.
