# [AG.DEP.6] Test landing zone changes in a mirrored non-production landing zone

**Category:** RECOMMENDED

Changes to landing zones can have significant impacts across
teams and processes because it is consumed by many teams in an
organization. To minimize the risk of potential failures when
making changes to the landing zone, platform teams should
follow similar practices seen in the development lifecycle,
including thorough testing and validation in a dedicated
environment before rolling out to production.

When making changes to a landing zone, establish mirrored landing zones for testing
changes before deploying to the production landing zone. This allows for changes to be
validated without affecting the production environment. Use deployment pipelines to
promote, validate, and deploy changes between the mirrored and production landing zones,
performing extensive testing and validation at each stage.

Overall, this practice promotes safer changes to the
production landing zone which has the potential to impact many
teams in the organization. Clearly communicate with those
teams before rolling out changes to the production landing
zone so that they are informed of imminent changes, potential
impacts to their environments and systems, and the projected
timeline.
