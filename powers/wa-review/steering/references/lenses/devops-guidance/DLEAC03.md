# [DL.EAC.3] Codify data operations

**Category:** FOUNDATIONAL

Codifying data operations in a DevOps environment extends the infrastructure as code
(IaC) principle to data management, which involves treating database schemas, data
transformations, and data pipelines as code. Codifying data operations enables other DevOps
capabilities including the use of data management pipelines for data lifecycle management,
enforcing quality assurance and governance standards, providing auditability of changes, and
the ability to rollback changes when necessary.

Store database schemas, along with any related procedures,
views, and triggers, in version control systems alongside your
application code. This enables the ability to track, review,
and test schema changes before deploying them to your
production environment. To start managing existing data source
schemas as code, database migration and event analysis tools
like
[AWS DMS Schema Conversion Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/) and
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) can help to infer schemas from existing
data sources.
