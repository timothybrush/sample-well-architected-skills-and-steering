# Anti-patterns for security testing

- **Overconfidence in test
results**: Being overly confident about a low
false-positive rate and not considering the potential of
false negatives can lead to genuine threats being ignored,
which may be exploited by attackers. Regularly re-evaluate
and adjust security testing tools and
methodologies. Consider periodic third-party security
audits and human-driven exploratory testing to get an
external perspective on the system's security posture.
- **Not considering internal threats**: Focusing security
testing solely on external threats while neglecting potential insider threats, whether
malicious or unintentional, can lead to unmitigated attack vectors that can be as
damaging as external attacks. Testing should encompass all potential threat
actors. Include scenarios in your testing strategy that emulate insider threats, such as
permissions escalation, data exfiltration from internal roles, and social engineering.
Continuously raise awareness, train employees on best practices, and regularly review
access permissions.
- **Neglecting software supply chain
attacks**: Not regularly monitoring or
safeguarding against potential threats in the software
supply chain, from third-party libraries to development
tools. Supply chain attacks have become increasingly
prevalent, and they can compromise systems even if the
organization's proprietary code is secure. Adopt a
comprehensive software supply chain security strategy,
including regularly updating and auditing third-party
components, monitoring development environments, and
ensuring secure software development practices are
followed by all components used to build, test, deploy,
and operate your systems.

# Metrics for security testing

- **Escaped defect rate**: The number of defects found by
users post-release compared to those identified during testing. A higher rate can
suggest gaps in the testing process and areas where user flows are not effectively
tested. An effective security testing process should aim to reduce the escaped defect
rate by increasing the vulnerability discovery rate. Track this metric by comparing the
number of post-release defects to the total defects identified.
- **False positive rate**: The ratio of identified security
threats that are later determined to be non-actionable or actual threats. Too many false
positives can lead to *alert fatigue*, causing genuine threats to be
overlooked. This metric indicates the accuracy and relevance of your security testing
tools. Compare the number of false positives against the total number of security alerts
raised over a period, such as monthly or quarterly.
- **Mean time to detect**: The average time it takes for an
organization to detect a security breach or vulnerability.  A shorter mean time
indicates that testing, monitoring, and alert systems are effective, leading to faster
detection of issues. A longer mean time may expose the organization to greater risks.
With effective security testing, you can detect anomalies faster—ideally before they are
deployed to production. Measure the time from when a vulnerability occurs to the time it
is detected. Calculate the average detection time over a defined period, such as monthly
or quarterly.
- **Mean time to remediate**:
The average time it takes for an organization to address
and resolve a detected security issue. A shorter mean time
implies that once a vulnerability is detected, the
organization can act quickly to mitigate risks. A longer
mean time suggests potential inefficiencies in the
incident response process. Having a strong security
testing practices in place ensures that you are
well-equipped to understand and remediate vulnerabilities
when they are detected, leading to faster
resolution. Measure the time from when a security issue is
detected to when it is resolved. Calculate the average
remediation time over a defined period, such as monthly or
quarterly.
- **Test pass rate**: The
percentage of test cases that pass successfully. This
metric provides an overview of the software's health and
readiness for release. If both the test pass rate and the
escaped defect rate are high, it could indicate that your
security tests are not effective enough. Conversely, a
declining pass rate can indicate emerging security issues.
Monitoring the test pass rate helps to evaluate the
effectiveness of quality assurance testing process.
Measure this by comparing the number of successful tests
to the total tests run.
- **Test case run
time**: The duration taken to run a test case
or a suite of test cases. Increasing duration may
highlight bottlenecks in the test process or performance
issues emerging in the software under test. Improve this
metric by optimizing test scripts and the order they run
in, enhancing testing infrastructure, and running tests in
parallel. Measure the timestamp difference between the
start and end of test case execution.
- **Vulnerability discovery rate**: The number of
vulnerabilities discovered during the testing phase per defined time period or release.
This metric helps assess the effectiveness of the security testing process. A higher
rate, especially when paired with a low false positive rate, may indicate a very
effective testing process, though if it remains high over time, it might indicate
recurring coding vulnerabilities. An unusually low vulnerability discovery rate could
indicate ineffective tests or lack of test coverage. Regularly track the number of
vulnerabilities detected in each testing cycle and compare it over time to determine
trends.
