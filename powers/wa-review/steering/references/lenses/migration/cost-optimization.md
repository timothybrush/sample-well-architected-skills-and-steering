# Assess

In the assess phase, prioritizing cost-effectiveness is essential.
This phase involves a comprehensive evaluation of existing
infrastructure usage and a thorough analysis of application
dependencies. By assessing these aspects, you can pinpoint
opportunities for optimizing costs throughout the migration
journey. To expedite this cost-effective assessment, consider
leveraging AWS programs and workshops designed to remove common
blockers and accelerate migrations. By incorporating these best
practices, you not only ensure a well-informed migration strategy,
but also lay the groundwork for maximizing cost efficiency in your
cloud migration.

MIG-COST-01: Are you collecting the right information about your source resources to create cost-optimized destination architectures?

Successful migrations require high-quality data about the source
environment and thorough analysis of technology, people, and
processes to move quickly and safely.

## MIG-COST-BP-1.1: Thoroughly assess existing infrastructure usage and application dependencies prior to migration

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
1.1.1:** Use discovery tools or existing
data to gather enough data about your source infrastructure
to make informed decisions about your target architecture.

Collect a complete inventory of assets to be migrated and
analyze dependencies between servers, databases, and
applications to create migration wave plans that minimize
network chatter and latency between source and target
infrastructure. Collect fine-grained infrastructure usage
data, including CPU, memory, and disk reads and writes. It's
important to understand actual usage from your source
servers, not just how many resources are allocated, in order
to right-size the target infrastructure in AWS.

These data should be gathered with frequent samples in order
to understand the minimum, average, and maximum usage over
time, typically at least two weeks. AWS and our partners
offer several tools that can help collect the required
information, such as
[Application
Discovery Service](https://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/) and

[Migration
Evaluator](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-evaluator/). Some customers already have this
information in their change management databases (CMDB) or
observability tools.

For more detail, see the following:

- [AWS Prescriptive Guidance regarding migration tool selection](https://aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/migration-tools/)
- [AWS Prescriptive Guidance regarding Application portfolio assessment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/application-portfolio-assessment-guide/introduction.html)
- [AWS Prescriptive Guidance for Wave Planning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/application-portfolio-assessment-guide/wave-planning.html)

## MIG-COST-BP-1.2: Leverage AWS programs and workshops designed to remove common blockers and accelerate migrations

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
1.2.1:** Leverage AWS and partner
programs and experience to improve assessments and identify
and remove costly blockers early.

The
[Migration
Acceleration Program (MAP)](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-acceleration-program/) provides tools that reduce
costs and automate and accelerate migration assessment and
implementation. In some cases AWS invests in customer
migrations in the form of service credits or

[partner
investments](https://aws.amazon.com/migration/partner-solutions/). MAP also leverages proven workshops such
as Migration Readiness Assessments,

[Experience-Based
Accelerators (EBA)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/level-up-your-cloud-transformation-with-experience-based-acceleration-eba/), and

[AWS Learning and Needs Analysis (LNA)](https://aws.amazon.com/training/teams/learning-needs-analysis/) to assess and
address technology, people, and processes that may create
costly blockers or reduce migration velocity.

**Suggestion
1.2.2:** Use the [AWS Optimization and
Licensing Assessment (OLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/optimization-and-licensing-assessment/) program to conduct thorough
discovery of existing Windows license footprints and cost
optimization exercises.

The AWS OLA delivers a comprehensive report that models your
deployment options based on actual resource use and your
existing licensing entitlements, helping you uncover
potential cost savings through our flexible licensing
options, including Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) and
license-included options.

# Mobilize

As you start planning for your migration in the mobilize phase,
you need to consider planning for optimizing resource utilization
and cost management. To achieve this, use existing automation
tools to streamline migration processes effectively. Additionally,
minimize data transfer to conserve bandwidth and mitigate data
egress costs, ensuring a cost-effective transition. Right-sizing
replication servers is essential to prevent bottlenecks without
unnecessary over-provisioning. Furthermore, establish robust cost
and usage governance through IAM policies and define a customized
cost allocation strategy tailored to your organization's financial
management needs. These practices collectively contribute to a
smooth and cost-efficient mobilization of your migration efforts.

MIG-COST-02: Are you using automation efficiently for your migration?

AWS and our partners offer a wide variety of tools and services
to help perform your migration. Use these tools efficiently to
reduce infrastructure and operational costs during the
migration.

## MIG-COST-BP-2.1: Leverage existing tools to automate your migration

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
2.1.1:** Understand the capabilities of
each tool available, and select the one best suited to your
situation.

AWS and our partners offer a
[range
of tools](https://aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/migration-tools/) to help migration. For instance, AWS Transform MGN can help with ongoing
replication, planning, testing, and cutover for lift and
shift server migrations.

[AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/migrate-wt-track.html) or

[Cloud
Migration Factory](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/cloud-migration-factory-on-aws/) can provide additional planning and
reporting functionality on top of MGN. Some tools are
purpose-built for specific workloads, such as

[Database
Migration Service (DMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) and

[Kubernetes
Migration Factory](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-kubernetes-migration-factory-kmf-to-migrate-from-google-kubernetes-engine-gke-to-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-amazon-eks/). There are also many other tools
offered by AWS partners.

## MIG-COST-BP-2.2: Minimize the number of applications and the amount of data that is migrated

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
2.2.1:** Only migrate what needs to be
migrated and minimize ongoing replication.

In the analyze and mobilize phases, you may have discovered
some applications that are still running but are no longer
needed. Those are easy targets to retire to limit how much
you're migrating. Consider discarding archival data that is
beyond its useful retention period. Non-production servers
for applications that are not in active development may also
be retired.

Additionally, ongoing replication, such as change data
capture (CDC) that MGN or AWS DMS uses, can consume a lot of
bandwidth when the rate of change in the source server is
high. Too much simultaneous replication may require
additional bandwidth to avoid network issues. If migrating
from another cloud service provider (CSP), you may incur
unnecessary data egress costs when you have unnecessary
replication. You can
[reduce
bandwidth requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/Troubleshooting-Communication-Errors.html#Calculating-Bandwidth) by limiting the time your
servers are actively replicating, as well as how many you
are replicating simultaneously, especially the source
servers with a high rate of change.

## MIG-COST-BP-2.3: Right-size your replication servers to prevent bottlenecks without over-provisioning

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
2.3.1:** Monitor your replication server
performance and adjust their size as needed.

You can monitor
[MGN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/instance-type.html)
and

[DMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_BestPractices.SizingReplicationInstance.html)
replication server performance in CloudWatch. A replication
server with too little performance causes a bottleneck that
can increase costs elsewhere, such as operations. A
replication server with too much performance can itself cost
more than it needs.

MIG-COST-03: Have you established standards to measure, monitor and create accountability to manage the cost of operating in the cloud?

AWS provides tools and services for measuring, monitoring and
creating accountability for your cloud spend. Your organization
should establish a financial attribution model for the migrated
resources. Creating a financial accountability model allows
departments to cross-charge departments for shared resources.

## MIG-COST-BP-3.1: Plan and set up cost and usage governance of AWS resources with help of IAM policies

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
3.1.1:** To effectively manage the costs
of your migration, it's essential to have robust control
over your AWS resource usage.

Before embarking on mass migrations, establish access
control standards in AWS by
[creating
and enforcing policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-service-control-policies-to-set-permission-guardrails-across-accounts-in-your-aws-organization/) that are closely tied to
migration objectives. These policies can be attached to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principals, including
roles or policies, as well as AWS resources. AWS offers
various policy types to provide the flexibility needed for
cost management within the migration process.

Identity-based policies should be employed to
[define
permissions for IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_iam_multiple-services-console.html). For instance, you can
attach a policy to an IAM role, specifying that the role is
permitted to launch specific instance types or access
particular services. These identity-based policies play a
crucial role in setting permissions boundaries, which
facilitate governance aimed at cost control.

Additionally, resource-based policies should be applied to
relevant AWS resources involved in your migration. For
example, these policies can be attached to S3 buckets,
Amazon SQS queues, VPC endpoints, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys, aligning security and access
controls with migration goals. This keeps cost management
tightly integrated with your migration strategy and
implementation.

For more detail, see the following:

- [How to manage cost overruns in your AWS multi-account environment](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/manage-cost-overruns-part-1/)
- [Control developer account costs with AWS CloudFormation and AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/control-developer-account-costs-with-aws-cloudformation-and-aws-budgets/)

## MIG-COST-BP-3.2: Define a cost allocation strategy that meets your organizations specific financial management process

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
3.2.1:** Migration cost can be optimized
by creating a cost awareness culture in your organization.

A good way to start this shift is by information teams on
how their decisions impact cost.
[Cost
allocation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/cost-allocation-basics-that-you-need-to-know/) is foundational to making informed
decisions to best support business outcomes. To do this, you
need to define a cost allocation strategy that speaks to
your specific financial management process, and ties cost
and resources usage data to the business needs and outcomes.

Set up
[resource
tagging for cost allocation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/cost-tagging-and-reporting-with-aws-organizations/).

[Create
your resource tags](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/gs-create-and-enforce-your-tagging-strategy-for-more-granular-cost-visibility/), and then activate your

[cost
allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the Billing and Cost Management
console. There are user-defined and AWS-generated cost
allocation tags. Based on the types of services you need to
tag and the level of customization you require, you can use
one of these two cost allocation tags or a hybrid of both.

[AWS Cost Categories](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-categories/) allows you to logically group
accounts and resources with attributes, such as tags, to
better map your cost and usage information to your
organizational structure.

Use four step process to design chargeback for shared
services (for example, central compute savings plans, or
enterprise support cost at billing account).

- Decide on the cost units to chargeback to.
- Calculate the total cost of the shared services.
- Choose a distribution logic (equitable or proportional).
- Gather the data to chargeback accurately.

For more detail, see
[Chargeback
| AWS Cloud Financial Management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/tag/chargeback/).

## MIG-COST-BP-3.3: Design a strategy to monitor, track and analyze your AWS cost and usage as you move resources to AWS

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
3.3.1:** Implement appropriate
management, tracking and measurement for your migration
cost.

You can use
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to

[collect
and track metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/monitor-track-and-analyze/), monitor log files, set alarms, and
automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. You
can also use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide
visibility into resource utilization, application
performance, and operational health.

With
[Trusted
Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/), you can provision your resources following
best practices to improve system performance and
reliability, increase security, and look for opportunities
to save money. You can also turn off non-production
instances, and use Amazon CloudWatch and autoscaling to
match increases or reductions in demand.

[AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) has an easy-to-use interface that lets
you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and
usage over time.  You can get started quickly by creating
custom reports that analyze cost and usage data. Analyze
your data at a high level (for example, total costs and
usage across all accounts), or dive deeper into your cost
and usage data to identify trends, pinpoint cost drivers,
and detect anomalies.

# Migrate

Cost optimization doesn't stop after you complete the migration to
Cloud. It's essential to seamlessly manage resources and optimize
costs on regular basis. Start by closely monitoring your resources
throughout both the migration and post-migration stages to ensure
smooth transitions. Develop a thoughtful metrics strategy to
demystify cloud economics, enabling informed decision-making.
Establish budgeting mechanisms to continually monitor cost and
usage, and construct user-friendly dashboards with pre-built
visualizations for enhanced visibility. Choose the right purchase
options and scalable architectures tailored to your specific
workloads, and consider a long-term modernization strategy that
embraces cost-effective cloud-native services.

MIG-COST-04: What custom monitoring strategies you have put in place to monitor and manage ongoing cost and usage data as you migrate resources to AWS?

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining and managing the
cost and usage of AWS resources during and after
migration. Customers use different AWS services and tools to
successfully manage and optimize their AWS bill.

## MIG-COST-BP-4.1: Create a deliberate metrics strategy to help demystify cloud economics

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
4.1.1:** Regularly evaluate cloud
metrics to ensure they meet current business needs.

Start by creating an effective metrics and reporting
strategy, then define a set of metrics to measure the
implementation of your strategy. See
[Crafting
a robust metrics strategy to quantify your benefits from the
cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/crafting-a-robust-metrics-strategy-to-quantify-your-benefits-from-the-cloud/) for some proven metrics that follow our
*see, save, plan,* and
*run* framework, and can serve as a
starting point for any company

## MIG-COST-BP-4.2: Monitor spend and limit unintended or unnecessary costs with budgeting and forecasting tools

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
4.2.1:** Migrating to AWS can likely
reduce your
[total
cost of ownership](https://aws.amazon.com/economics/) (TCO), but you still need an
effective cost control mechanism to make sure you only pay
for what you need.

Set up your cost control system, by focusing on the
following core principles:

- Budget your spend with custom thresholds.
- Monitor and analyze how your costs progress toward
limits.
- Take action to reduce unintended costs.

[AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) gives you the ability to set custom budgets
that alert you when your costs or usage (actual or
forecasted) exceed your budgeted amount. With the recent
launch of

[AWS Budget actions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/get-started-with-aws-budgets-actions/), you can now preconfigure actions that
can trigger the implementation of

[AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (IAM) policies or

[service
control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCPs). In addition, you can stop
target

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (Amazon EC2) or

[Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instances in your account.

In a multi-account AWS environment, there are two patterns
for managing the budget that you can choose from based on
your organization's governance structure:

- Centralized budget management, where the budget is set
by the management account for all its member accounts
- Decentralized budget management, where the budget is set
for individual member accounts by its owners

For more detail, see the following:

- [How to manage cost overruns in your AWS multi-account environment – Part 1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/manage-cost-overruns-part-1/)
- [Control developer account costs with AWS CloudFormation and AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/control-developer-account-costs-with-aws-cloudformation-and-aws-budgets/)
- [Smart
Budgeting Using Lambda and Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/smart-budgeting-using-lambda-and-service-catalog)

## MIG-COST-BP-4.3: Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection in Cost Explorer to quickly improve cost controls

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
4.3.1:**
[Cost
Anomaly Detection](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/new-aws-cost-explorer-users-can-now-automatically-detect-cost-anomalies/) is an

[AWS Cost Management](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/) service that uses advanced machine
learning to detect anomalous spend and provide
contextualized alert notifications through email and

[Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

Each anomaly includes root cause analysis and direct links
to further investigate in Cost Explorer to understand the
unexpected usage and its drivers.

The default configuration includes the creation of an AWS
services monitor, which tracks charges of most AWS services
(see
[Quotas
and restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/management-limits.html#limits-ad)) deployed now, or in the future, by
your management and member accounts. It also includes a
daily email subscription, which sends an email if any
anomaly is detected or ongoing during that specific day. By
default, the primary email address associated with the
account will receive a daily summary email for any service
anomaly detected that is above $100 and exceeds 40% of the
expected spend.

## MIG-COST-BP-4.4: Use dashboards that provide pre-built visualizations to help you get a detailed view of your AWS usage and costs as you move resources to AWS

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Expenditure and usage awareness

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
4.4.1:**AWS Cost Explorer provides a
high-level view of costs and usage, using the same dataset that
is used to generate the AWS Cost and Usage Reports.

To extract resource-level granularity, you can use Amazon Athena
queries, which requires familiarity and previous experience to
build complex SQL queries.

Having dashboards that provide pre-built visualizations can help
you get a detailed view of your AWS usage and costs.

The
[Cloud
Intelligence Dashboards](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/) are a collection of

[Quick](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/)

[dashboards](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/visualize-and-gain-insights-into-your-aws-cost-and-usage-with-cloud-intelligence-dashboards-using-amazon-quicksight/).
They offer powerful visuals, in-depth insights, and intuitive
querying without having to build complex solutions or share your
cost data with third-party companies.

The
[Cost
Intelligence Dashboard](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/cost-usage-report-dashboards/dashboards/2a_cost_intelligence_dashboard/),

[CUDOS
Dashboard](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/#cudos-dashboard),

[Trusted
Advisor Organization (TAO) Dashboard](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/#trusted-advisor-organizational-tao-dashboard), and

[Trends
Dashboard](https://cudos.workshop.aws/workshop-trends.html) are built on native AWS services. They are
inherently secure because the data resides in the organization.
They inherit all the features of Quick, including
integration with

[AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), which makes them highly secure, and
Quick being a serverless service allows you to pay
as you go and scale on demand.

You do not need coding or SQL skills to customize these
dashboards. The visualizations include Machine Learning (ML)
driven insights, live trends, actionable recommendations, links
to relevant blog posts and AWS service documentation that help
you make informed business decisions.

MIG-COST-05: How are you ensuring your target infrastructure is optimized for your workloads?

AWS has a lot of options for instance shapes and sizes, purchase
options, scaling options, and managed services. Consider how you
can leverage these capabilities during and after migration to
maximize cost benefits from your cloud infrastructure.

## MIG-COST-BP-5.1: Leverage the right purchase options and scalable architecture for your workloads

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
5.1.1:** Leverage the right purchase
model for your workload.

Selecting the correct purchasing models can greatly reduce
the total cost of running a workload. Workloads with fairly
consistent resource requirements should consider reserved
instances or savings plans to save up to 72 percent on cost
compared to the same resources purchased on-demand. On the
other hand, some workloads, such as question and answer (QA)
environments, may be temporary or intermittent. This type of
workload may benefit from
[Spot
Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-leveraging-ec2-spot-instances/when-to-use-spot-instances.html), which can be much more cost effective for
well-fit workloads compared to comparable on-demand
resources.

In some cases, licensing may have an impact on purchasing
models. For instance, some licenses are bound to physical
cores and not transferable to an EC2 instance. In this case,
it may be more cost effective to purchase a
[dedicated
host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html) to use for the duration of those licenses. For
more detail, see

[EC2
Reservation Models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-reservation-models/welcome.html).

**Suggestion
5.1.2:** Use fine-grained data collected
in the assess phase to right-size your infrastructure as
you're migrating.

It is unlikely that the resources allocated to your source
infrastructure are exactly what your workload is using. The
cloud offers more flexibility when provisioning resources
and makes it easier to change the size and shape of the
provisioned resources. By sizing your target infrastructure
to the actual usage, you can see immediate cost savings by
migrating to the cloud.

When selecting your target resources, consider
[burstable
performance instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html), which allow you to run a
workload at a fraction of the cost of comparable-sized
non-burstable instances. These instances are especially
cost-effective for non-production or other workloads that
are often near-idle.

**Suggestion
5.1.3:** Enable autoscaling immediately
after migrating when your workload allows it.

Autoscaling can have a significant impact on infrastructure
costs, especially for applications that that have large
fluctuations in compute capacity needs over time. If you are
able to autoscale, consider that when sizing your target
infrastructure. Choose instances that are between your
minimum and average compute, memory, and disk usage, and
make sure your autoscaling rules allow you to scale up to at
least the maximum expected usage.

## MIG-COST-BP-5.2: Identify resources during migration that are likely candidates for cost optimizations later

This BP applies to the following best practice areas:
Cost-effective resources

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
5.3.1:** Tag your resources as you're
migrating to make additional cost optimizations later.

It's often not feasible to make every cost optimization
during the initial migration. Tag resources as they're being
created to distinguish important categories that can help
with cost optimization later. For instance, tag production
and pre-production instances so you can use the tags later
to automate stopping pre-production instances at night.

MIG-COST-06: What cost optimization tools are you leveraging to reduce your cloud spend?

Once you have successfully migrated workloads to AWS, it is
critical to choose the right set of AWS cost optimization tools
that provide ability to manage, monitor, and track your spend in
the cloud. Understanding your cost structure in comprehensive
manner and applying it across spectrum of AWS services allows
you to implement the right cost optimization solutions in order
to optimize your operational cost after migration or
modernization.

## MIG-COST-BP-6.1: Use automation to re-evaluate your compute usage periodically

This question applies to best practice area:  Optimize over
time

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
6.1.1:** Employ cost-optimization tools
built specifically for AWS infrastructure.

AWS provides comprehensive cost management tools for cost
optimization. Most workloads continue to evolve over time.
Use combination of cost optimization tools to continue
cost-optimization post-migration such as Compute Optimizer,
Trusted Advisor, rightsizing recommendations, Savings Plans
(SP) and Reserve Instances (RI) reports, Amazon CloudWatch
alarms, and Amazon S3 Lens based on various services that
are part of your AWS environments. These tools analyze your
AWS usage and make simple, actionable suggestions to reduce
costs of running your workloads on AWS, while incorporating
the latest features and pricing.

- [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/): Provides
recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.
Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks.
These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS
infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce
costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow
the recommendations to optimize your services and
resources.
- [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/): Identifies whether
your AWS resources are optimal, and offers
recommendations to improve cost and performance. It
helps us with rightsizing recommendations by avoiding
over provisioning and under provisioning.
- [Rightsizing
recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-rightsizing.html): This feature in AWS Cost Explorer helps you identify cost-saving
opportunities by downsizing or terminating instances in
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Rightsizing
recommendations analyze your Amazon EC2 resources and
usage to show opportunities for how you can lower your
spending.
- **SP and RI reports**: If
you own

[Savings
Plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-monitoring.html)s or

[Reserved
Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/reserved-instance-reporting/), this helps to understand how much SP
or RI to purchase. Once you purchase, it also helps you
understand the coverage, which is a measure of how many
instances are covered out of all your EC2 and RDS
instances.
- [Amazon CloudWatch:](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
Provides detailed monitoring of infrastructure
components at a line item about different services being
consumed and allows to set near real-time alarms for
Cloud Watch.
- [Amazon S3 Lens:](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-lens/) Allows customers to get
visibility into their Amazon S3 usage. Amazon S3 Storage
Lens is a single place to understand Amazon S3
consumption and provides recommendations for objects
that haven't been accessed for long time, different
storage tiers, and other storage related metrics.

Follow rightsizing recommendations provided by combination
of different AWS native Cloud Financial Management tools.

MIG-COST-07: How are you prioritizing your migrated AWS workloads and further driving cost optimization through modernization?

Migrations don't end when a workload is in AWS. It's important
to continue to optimize costs post-migration to get the most
value from the cloud. There are various modernization pathways
that allow you to further optimize your cost profile on AWS
while delivering innovative solutions, reducing time-to-value
and improving customer experiences.

## MIG-COST-BP-7.1: Create a plan early to optimize after the initial migration

This question applies to best practice area:  Optimize over
time

### Implementation guidance

**Suggestion
7.1.1:**Depending on your specific AWS
architecture and services being deployed, there are a number
of techniques to further optimize cost both at the
infrastructure layer, including refactoring your application
to take advantage of modern, cloud-native services.

- **Use newer, cost-efficient
compute options available for your
workloads:** There are three important ways to
optimize compute costs, and AWS has tools to help you
with all of them. It starts with choosing the right
[Amazon EC2 purchase model](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/cost-and-capacity/) for your workloads, then
selecting the right instance to fine tune price and
performance, and finally mapping usage to actual demand.
- **Use an optimal combination of
AWS Managed Services:** Depending on your
existing AWS architecture, you can re-platform
applications to further save on operating costs in the
cloud. If you are running a SQL database on Amazon EC2,
modernizing to an Amazon RDS managed service can remove
lot of undifferentiated heavy-lifting and lower overall
total cost of ownership (TCO).
- **Modernization
pathways**: The four most popular
[modernization
pathways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/modernization-pattern-list.html) are as follows:

**Serverless:** Helps
organizations to build and run applications without
provisioning or managing infrastructure. These
services, such as AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate, allow
organizations to worry less about operational
overhead and have a faster time to market. Features
like automatic scaling and pay-for-use billing drive
business agility and cost-efficiency.
- **Containers**: Containers
provide a standard way to package an application's
code, configurations, and dependencies into a single
object. Examples of container services include
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS
Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
- **Managed data:** A
fully managed, purpose-built database service,
supporting diverse data models and applications.
- **Managed
analytics:** A range of services supporting
analytics use cases like data lake initiatives, big
data processing, real-time analytics, and
operational analytics.
