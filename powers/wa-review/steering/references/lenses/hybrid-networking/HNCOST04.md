# HNCOST04-BP01 Implement data transfer optimization techniques

Optimizing data transfer between AWS and on-premises environments
through compression and efficient transfer protocols is crucial for
reducing hybrid networking costs. Implementing appropriate
optimization techniques can significantly reduce bandwidth
consumption while maintaining required performance levels across
hybrid connections.

**Desired outcome:** Reduced data
transfer costs across hybrid network connections while maintaining
application performance and reliability through optimized traffic
patterns and compression techniques.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Lower bandwidth utilization across dedicated connections or
IPSec VPN connections
- Reduced data transfer costs for hybrid network traffic
- Improved application performance across hybrid environments
- More efficient use of hybrid network capacity
- Better cost predictability for network usage
- Optimized throughput for critical applications

## Implementation guidance

- Optimize application-level transfer:

Enable compression for application protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Configure TCP optimization for hybrid connections
- Implement efficient data replication strategies
- Use bulk transfer windows for large datasets

- Configure network optimization:

Enable protocol compression on IPSec VPN connections
- Implement QoS policies for traffic prioritization
- Configure WAN optimization for dedicated connections
- Optimize routing policies for efficient paths

- Monitor and analyze:

Track bandwidth utilization across hybrid links
- Monitor compression effectiveness
- Analyze traffic patterns and peak usage
- Review cost impact of optimization measures

- Regular review and adjustment:

Assess optimization effectiveness
- Update compression policies as needed
- Fine-tune network configurations
- Validate cost savings

# HNCOST04-BP02 Select cost-effective regions and availability zones

Selecting the appropriate AWS Region and Availability Zone (AZ) is
crucial for optimizing hybrid networking and reducing data transfer
costs. AWS pricing for services such as compute, storage, and data
transfer can vary significantly across regions due to differences in
operational costs, local demand, and infrastructure. However, it is
important to balance cost savings with performance, compliance, and
data residency requirements. Some regions may have lower prices but
might also have limited services availability or higher latency for
end users. Regularly reviewing AWS pricing updates and reassessing
region and AZ choices ensures ongoing cost efficiency as your needs
evolve.

**Desired outcome:** Minimize
infrastructure and data transfer costs by strategically placing
resources in regions and AZs that offer the best balance of price,
performance, and compliance.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Significant reduction in compute, storage, and data transfer
costs
- Improved cost predictability for DR and test environments
- Enhanced ability to scale and optimize hybrid workloads
- Opportunity to leverage AWS pricing differences for competitive
advantage

## Implementation guidance

- Compare regional pricing for compute, storage, and data
transfer before deploying workloads
- Use lower-cost regions for DR, backups, and test platforms
where performance and compliance permit
- Minimize inter-region and inter-AZ data transfers to avoid
additional charges
- Consider service availability and latency when selecting
regions and AZs
- Monitor AWS pricing changes and adjust resource placement
strategies accordingly

# HNCOST04-BP03 Implement compression and caching for repetitive data transfers

Reduce data transfer volumes by compressing in-transit data and
caching frequently accessed content at the edge.

**Desired outcome:** Reduction in
data transfer volumes and associated costs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Lower bandwidth consumption
- Faster transfer times
- Reduced storage costs for compressed data

## Implementation guidance

- Enable compression for payloads
- Configure TTL for static assets in content delivery network
such as Amazon CloudFront
- Use compression for file/volume syncs using services such as
AWS Storage Gateway
