# HNCOST01-BP01 Implement a comprehensive tagging strategy for hybrid networking resources

Apply consistent tags to all hybrid networking components to enable
cost allocation and usage analysis. Teams gain visibility into
resource usage patterns, improve cost attribution, and enhance
operational governance.

**Desired outcome:** Accurate
attribution of hybrid networking expenses to specific workloads,
teams, or business units.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Transparent cost accountability for cross-functional teams
- Identification of underutilized resources for optimization
- Improved forecasting through historical cost trends
- Simplified chargeback and showback processes

## Implementation guidance

- Define standardized tags (for example, Environment, Workload,
and CostCenter) for hybrid networking resources.
- Enforce tagging compliance. For example, you can achieve this
using AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) or AWS Config rules.
- Organize resources by tags. For example, you can achieve this
using AWS Resource Groups.
