# HNREL02-BP01 Monitor network service provider maintenance events

Implementing a proactive monitoring and response system for
scheduled network maintenance activities is crucial for minimizing
service disruptions. By establishing a methodical framework to track
maintenance notifications and planned network events, teams can
prepare effectively, strategically schedule necessary changes during
designated maintenance windows, and ensure continuous network
connectivity throughout the process. This systematic approach
enhances operational resilience while reducing the impact of
essential maintenance on critical services

**Desired outcome:**

- Get timely notifications about links connecting the on-premises
data center to the cloud.
- Enables proper planning for scheduled activities, minimizes
service disruptions, and ensures optimal management of hybrid
network connectivity.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Proactive maintenance planning and reduces the risk of
unexpected service disruptions.
- Better coordination during maintenance windows with business
operations, minimizing impact on critical workloads.
- Enhanced visibility into service health and upcoming changes

## Implementation guidance

- Integrate service provider notifications into monitoring and
observability platforms. For example, you can achieve this
using Amazon EventBridge to send AWS Direct Connect
maintenance messages.
