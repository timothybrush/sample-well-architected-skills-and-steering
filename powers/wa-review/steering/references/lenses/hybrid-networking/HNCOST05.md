# HNCOST05-BP01 Forecast demand and baseline requirements before scaling dedicated connections

Begin with IPSec VPN or small-scale dedicated connection links
during testing or migration phases. Monitor traffic patterns to
establish baseline bandwidth needs. Scale to larger dedicated
connections or LAGs only after validating requirements.

**Desired outcome:** Cost-efficient
scaling that matches actual workload demands, avoiding premature
investment in underutilized dedicated connections.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduces upfront capital expenditure
- Prevents over-provisioning of high-cost dedicated links
- Enables data-driven scaling decisions

## Implementation guidance

- Analyze historical data transfer costs using services such as
Cost Explorer or Cost and Usage
- Analyze traffic patterns using services such as VPC Flow Logs
or Transit Gateway Flog Logs
