# GENSUS01-BP01 Implement auto scaling and serverless architectures to optimize resource utilization

Adopt efficient and sustainable AI/ML practices to minimize resource
usage, reduce costs, and lower environmental impact. Use serverless
architectures, auto scaling, and specialized hardware to optimize
resource utilization. This approach enhances performance efficiency,
aligns with cost optimization, and supports sustainability goals.
Implementing these practices enables responsible and economical
deployment of generative AI workloads and promotes effective scaling
without unnecessary resource waste.

**Desired outcome:** After
implementing this best practice, customers can improve the
elasticity of their generative AI workloads and benefit from the
efficiencies of scale of the AWS Cloud.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**
[Optimize
resource utilization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html) - Minimize environmental impact by
maximizing the efficiency of generative AI resources.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Adopting serverless architectures and auto-scaling capabilities is
essential for verifying that resources are provisioned and
consumed only when needed. This approach minimizes idle
consumption and reduces the associated environmental impact. While
training jobs may run overnight, the notebook and ML development
instances that are not in use can be shut down either through
configuring an idle time-out or through scheduling. You can
further enhance the efficiency of your workload's resource
utilization by using AWS managed services and managed offerings.

Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q are fully-managed services, which
means that AWS handles the infrastructure management, scaling, and
maintenance. As a result, users can focus on model development
rather than infrastructure utilization. Similarly,
[Amazon SageMaker AI Inference Recommender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-recommender.html) helps optimize the
deployment of machine learning models by automating load testing.
It assists in selecting the best instance type by considering
factors like instance count, container parameters, and model
optimizations. This tool provides recommendations for both
real-time and serverless inference endpoints, which helps you
verify that models are deployed with the best performance at the
lowest resource consumption.

For hosting and running generative AI models efficiently, consider
using Amazon EC2 Inferentia instances. These instances deliver
some of the highest compute power and accelerator memory in among
EC2 instance families, which is crucial for handling large
language models and other generative AI workloads. Inferentia
instances support scale-out distributed inference to optimize
compute consumption. The improved performance per watt translates
to more efficient use of resources. By integrating these AWS
services and features, organizations can achieve a more
sustainable and cost-effective approach to generative AI
workloads.

In SageMaker AI HyperPod with both Amazon EKS and Slurm
orchestration, use the system's managed infrastructure
capabilities and built-in scaling mechanisms to minimize
resource waste while maintaining optimal performance.

Self-hosted models can scale to zero when not in use.
Implement scale-to-zero for periods of low-utilization,
configuring autoscaling policies to scale back up quickly
where appropriate.

### Implementation steps

# GENSUS01-BP02 Use efficient model customization services

To maximize efficiency and sustainability in large-scale generative
AI model deployments, adopt best practices for distributed training
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. These techniques optimize
resource utilization and reduce energy consumption, leading to cost
savings and enhanced performance. This helps maintain a balance
between computational demands and environmental considerations,
promoting responsible cloud resource use.

**Desired outcome:** After
implementing this practice, your organization can create an
environmentally-sustainable infrastructure for training,
customizing, and hosting generative AI workloads.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**
[Optimize
resource utilization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html) - Minimize environmental impact through
efficient use of generative AI model customization resources.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Amazon Bedrock offers managed model customization features for
fine-tuning and continued pre-training to improve the model's
domain knowledge. It optimizes the infrastructure management,
scaling, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus on model
performance rather than the underlying infrastructure.

Amazon SageMaker AI offers several features to train generative AI
models efficiently. SageMaker AI HyperPod is designed specifically
for large-scale generative AI model training. HyperPod provides
pre-tested training stacks for popular generative AI models, which
helps users start their training processes with confidence. It
offers optimized distributed training and enables the efficient
use of multiple instances for large-scale model training. This
distributed approach speeds up training times, making it feasible
to train even advanced models in a reasonable timeframe.

Users can choose from a variety of instance types, including GPU
and AWS Trainium instances. AWS Trainium instances deliver a
reduction in energy consumption compared to comparable instances
for training large deep learning models, including large language
models (LLMs). This makes training more cost-effective and
efficient.

Parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), can be applied when using Trainium
with HyperPod. These techniques make the fine-tuning of LLMs more
efficient by reducing the number of parameters that need to be
updated, which speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduces time
and cost.

Managed spot training is a feature that allows the use of spare
Amazon EC2 capacity which can lead to more efficient resource
utilization across the infrastructure. This means that users can
get lower-cost, surplus computing power while meeting quality and
speed of training goals.

SageMaker AI Debugger helps detect and stop training jobs early if
issues are identified, minimizing wasted compute resources. This
feature helps verify that users are only paying for the resources
they actually need, further optimizing the cost and efficiency of
their generative AI model training processes.

### Implementation steps

- Select the right AWS services.

Amazon Bedrock has managed model customization where
resource utilization is handled by AWS
- Amazon SageMaker AI offers advanced training features and
full control of the underlying infrastructure choices

- Set up SageMaker AI HyperPod for large-scale distributed
training.

Use pre-tested stacks for popular models to streamline
setup
- Consider AWS Trainium instances for reduced energy
consumption compared to traditional instances
- Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning with HyperPod for
fine-tuning large language models, reducing the
computational and energy requirements

- Use managed spot training.

Implement managed spot training to utilize spare Amazon EC2 capacity, leading to better underlying resource
utilization
- Set up the checkpointing feature to handle spot instance
interruptions and restart from the last point of
completion

- Enable SageMaker AI Debugger.

Use Debugger to monitor and optimize training job
resource utilization
- Configure rules to identify and halt training jobs early
in case of issues, minimizing wasted compute resources

- Optimize resource utilization and cost.

Analyze usage patterns to adjust instance types and
counts
- Use auto scaling features
- Use cost allocation tags to track detailed resource
consumption and for billing analysis
