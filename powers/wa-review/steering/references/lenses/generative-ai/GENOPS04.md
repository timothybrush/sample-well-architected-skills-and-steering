# GENOPS04-BP01 Automate generative AI application lifecycle with infrastructure as code (IaC)

Implementing and managing IaC is crucial for consistent,
version-controlled, and automated infrastructure deployment across
environments. This practice streamlines deployment, reduces errors,
and enhances team collaboration. IaC helps customers achieve
efficiency, reliability, and scalability in infrastructure
management, which allows for rapid iteration, straightforward
rollback, and improved governance and results in secure deployments.

**Desired outcome:** After
implementing the practice of automating the lifecycle management of
generative AI workloads using IaC, customers have version control
infrastructure automated through CI/CD pipelines.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**
[Safely
automate where possible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html) - Define your entire workload and its
operations (applications, infrastructure, configuration, and
procedures) as code, facilitating infrastructure level change
management, infrastructure version control, and advanced paradigms
such as self-healing infrastructure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Automate your application development and migration through stages
using IaC principles. When selecting your tool stack, consider
your team's skills and project requirements. Use tools such as AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), AWS CloudFormation, or Terraform
to define and manage the infrastructure resources required for
your application. These resources may include Amazon Bedrock,
Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions, and AWS Data Pipelines, all of which help you create a reproducible and
version-controlled stack.

Store your IaC templates in a version control system like Git.
This practice facilitates collaboration among team members, allows
for tracking changes over time, and enables rolling back to
previous versions if necessary.

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or a
similar tool. This pipeline should initiate on code changes, run
tests on your IaC templates, and automatically deploy
infrastructure changes.

Manage your IaC templates to handle multiple environments such as
development, testing and staging, and production. To maintain
consistency across environments, use the same templates with
different parameters.

For Hyperpod, use AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, or Terraform to
define clusters, VPCs, security groups, EKS node groups,
networking policies, and Amazon SageMaker AI resources.

For Amazon EKS, describe your Kubernetes deployments, secrets
management, and ML workflows in YAML or Helm charts, and then
manage those using CI/CD pipelines to automatically provision
and update infrastructure.

For Slurm, automate creation and scaling of compute nodes,
tracker scripts, and cluster configuration using the same IaC
tools.

HyperPod Recipes serve as the cornerstone for implementing
operational task automation by providing pre-built automation
frameworks that reduce the need for manual operational tasks
in distributed training environments. These recipes deliver
IaC templates that automatically provision, configure, and
manage complex training workflows across both EKS and Slurm
orchestrated clusters, directly addressing the core principle
of reducing manual effort and minimizing human error in
operational activities.

Establish practices and controls to help you maintain
compliance of your resources, like using AWS Config to track
resource configurations. Implement Service Catalog for
standardized resource provisioning, and regularly audit your
IaC templates for security best practices and compliance.

Be mindful of the time and cost involved in model training and
customization when automating these activities for your
workload, use historical data to determine when training and
customization might be needed for your workload.

### Implementation steps

# GENOPS04-BP02 Implement GenAIOps to optimize the application lifecycle

To optimize generative AI workloads, organizations should implement
[GenAIOps](https://genaiops.ai/), a best
practice that automates the development, deployment, and management
of models. This approach establishes CI/CD pipelines for training,
tuning, and deploying foundation models. GenAIOps enhances
operational efficiency, reduces time-to-market, and enables
consistent, high-quality model performance. It creates a robust,
automated framework that supports the entire generative AI project
lifecycle from development to production deployment. Through
GenAIOps, customers can achieve greater agility, improved model
reliability, and quick adaptation to changing business requirements,
driving innovation and competitive advantage.

**Desired outcome:** After
implementing GenAIOps, organizations can have a robust, automated
framework for managing the entire lifecycle of generative AI
workloads.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**
[Safely
automate where possible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html) - automate the lifecycle of your
foundation models.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

GenAIOps is a specialized subset of machine learning operations
(MLOps) that focuses on the processes and techniques for managing
and operationalizing foundation models in production environments.
Organizations can harness the power of foundation models while
reducing risks and optimizing their deployments. There are two
categories under GenAIOps: operationalizing foundation model
consumption and operationalizing foundation model training and
tuning. Common concerns across both categories include CI/CD,
prompt management, versioning of artifacts, model upgrades,
evaluation, and monitoring.

For operationalizing applications that consume foundation models,
the model-consuming applications will follow traditional DevOps
processes. Applications are often built using complex
orchestration patterns such as RAG and agents. Operationalizing
RAG applications involves the choice of vector database, indexing
pipelines, and retrieval strategies.

For operationalizing foundation model training and tuning, it is
essential to perform efficient training, tuning, and deployment of
foundation models using automation. Foundation model operations
(FMOps), which is the operationalization of foundation models, and
large language model operations (LLMOps), which is specifically
the operationalization of LLMs, fall under this category. This
involves model selection, continuous tuning and training of
models, experiment tracking, a central model registry, prompt
management and evaluation, and deployment of the models.

Amazon SageMaker AI Pipelines is a serverless workflow orchestration
service specifically designed for MLOps and LLMOps automation. Set
up SageMaker AI Pipelines to build, run, and monitor repeatable
end-to-end ML workflows for LLMs, from data preparation to model
deployment. The service can scale to run tens of thousands of
concurrent ML workflows in production, which is particularly
useful when working with resource-intensive LLMs. Self-managed
MLFlow or SageMaker AI MLFlow is well-suited for tracking
experiments, cataloging the models, approving them, and deploying
them to production.

Amazon Bedrock provides a managed RAG feature called Knowledge
Bases, which automates the indexing and ingestion into various
vector database options and orchestrates the retrieval process.
Amazon Bedrock Agents use the reasoning of foundation models,
APIs, and data to break down user requests, gather relevant
information, and efficiently complete tasks. Amazon Bedrock has
managed features for continued pretraining and finetuning of
foundation models.

### Implementation steps

- For SageMaker AI, implement pipelines.

Use SageMaker AI SDK to add steps which may include data
preparation, model training, model evaluation, and model
deployment
- Use SageMaker AI Processing to run evaluation scripts on the
trained model with SageMaker AI Clarify

pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy with Amazon SageMaker AI Projects

- Enable MLflow experiment tracking.

In Amazon SageMaker AI Studio, configure MLflow tracking
- Use MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts
during your model training process
- These will be automatically tracked and stored in your
SageMaker AI-managed MLflow server
- Use the MLflow UI in SageMaker AI Studio to analyze metrics
and artifacts to determine the best model iterations
- Register your best models in the MLflow Model Registry

- Use a version control system.

Use a Git compatible repository to manage code and
configurations effectively
- Set up SageMaker AI Model Registry to catalog and version
models

- Set up monitoring and logging.

Monitor real-time FM metrics with Amazon CloudWatch
- Centralize logging with Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

Gather user feedback and model performance data
- Automate retraining and model updates based on new data
