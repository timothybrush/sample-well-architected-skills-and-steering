# GENCOST02-BP01 Balance cost and performance when selecting inference paradigms

Hosting a foundation model for inference requires many choices, and
many of these decisions can affect the cost of your workload. One of
these choices includes the selection of a managed, serverless
deployment of a foundation model against a self-hosted option.

**Desired outcome:** When
implemented, this best practice describes a relationship between
cost and performance contextualized against model hosting and
inference paradigms. This relationship helps you evaluate
cost-benefit choices associated with the selection of an inference
paradigm.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- [Measure
overall efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html) - It is helpful to understand
inference and hosting costs associated with the performance
requirements of foundation model.
- [Lower
spend on undifferentiated heavy lifting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html) - More often than
not, it is beneficial to opt for a managed or serverless hosting
paradigm, due to the intractability of the total cost of
ownership for foundation model hosting.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Throughput sensitive workloads often require additional resources
to service inference requests at the rate they are being
submitted. Provisioned throughput, available through Amazon Bedrock, provides increased throughput capability for large
language models supporting generative AI workloads. If your
workload requires provisioned throughput to meet its performance
requirements, consider preferring longer commitment terms for
better unit costs. Validate your scaling requirements with shorter
duration commitments to avoid over-provisioning your workload.
Provisioned throughput is available for purchase in Amazon Bedrock. If the model you are using has throughput performance
needs or continuous model inference scale supports provisioned
throughput, consider purchasing a short-term. Test the improvement
and determine if the provisioned throughput improves your
application's performance. If there is a strong case for
provisioned throughput, consider purchasing a six-month plan, as
the unit cost for six months is usually lower than purchasing
month-over-month.

Consider a scenario where you want to serve inference capabilities for a single model for small, periodic workloads. Evaluate the cost of hosting this model on an Amazon SageMaker AI inference endpoint. Compare these costs against the cost of importing the model to Amazon Bedrock using Amazon Bedrock's Custom Model Import feature and using API-based inference. Evaluate the cost to deploy this model using either paradigm and compare them with respect to the total cost of ownership. Where performance trade-offs are negligible, deploy to the most cost-effective inference paradigm.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the nature of the demand for this workload.
- Compare the demand to the available hosting options, and
remove the high-cost options that do not satisfy the
workloads hosting requirements.
- Select and test the available optinos that satisfy the workload requirements for latency, throughput, and response quality.
- Implement the most appropriate, lower-cost hosting option for your model serving paradigm (for example, managed or self-hosted).

# GENCOST02-BP02 Optimize resource consumption to minimize hosting costs

Hosting a foundation model for inference requires myriad choices,
all of which affect cost. These cost dimensions can be optimized to
reduce cost while meeting performance goals.

**Desired outcome:** When
implemented, this best practice describes a relationship between
cost and performance contextualized in self-hosted foundation model
hosting.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- [Measure
overall efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html) - It is helpful to understand
inference and hosting costs associated with the performance
requirements of foundation model.
- [Stop
spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html) - More
often than not, it is beneficial to opt for a managed or
serverless hosting paradigm, due to the intractability of the
total cost of ownership for foundation model hosting.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Self-hosted model infrastructure should be optimized based on the
model used and the workload's usage pattern. Customers
self-hosting models should also consider optimizing the model's
hosting infrastructure. Consider right-sizing the inference
endpoint to the smallest instance available that allows you to
meet performance goals. In some scenarios, it may be appropriate
to shut down the hosting instance and restart it during relevant
hours. This is particularly useful for workloads with predictable
usage patterns. You may also consider purchasing [Amazon EC2 Reserved
Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/) or Savings Plans to further reduce the cost of a hosted
model endpoint. Before committing to compute reservation, consider
Amazon SageMaker AI Inference Recommender to evaluate if you are
using the ideal inference endpoint type, generation, and size.

In SageMaker AI HyperPod with both Amazon EKS and Slurm
orchestration, use the system's advanced task governance
capabilities and flexible training plans to dynamically
allocate compute resources based on priority and demand,
reducing costs through improved utilization.

For EKS-based HyperPod, implement the managed Kubernetes
orchestration with Hyperpod Task Governance. Configure
automated scaling policies, priority classes, and node
selectors to verify that your production workloads use
cost-effective committed capacity while development tasks use
On-Demand or Spot Instances when appropriate. Use the usage
reporting feature to provide granular visibility into GPU,
CPU, and Neuron Core consumption at both team and task levels,
enabling transparent cost attribution and reducing guesswork
in resource allocation.

For Slurm-based HyperPod, use Slurm's native job scheduling
and resource management features combined with HyperPod's
auto-resume functionality to minimize wasted compute cycles
during hardware failures, potentially reducing total training
time in large clusters. Both systems benefit from implementing
right-sizing strategies through SageMaker AI HyperPod Recipes
that provide pre-configured, benchmarked training stacks
optimized for specific model architectures like Llama and
Mistral, providing optimized performance while minimizing
resource waste.

Additionally, establish flexible training plans that can set
timeline and budget constraints, and allow HyperPod to
automatically find the best combination of capacity blocks and
create cost-optimized execution plans that avoid overspending
by overprovisioning servers for training jobs.

Inference workloads can be optimized using advanced techniques
such as quantization or LoRA adaptation. These advanced
capabilities are available for certain models in Amazon
Bedrock or on self-hosted models on Amazon SageMaker AI. These
advanced inference techniques can further optimize resource
consumption for inference, thus reducing hosting and inference
serving costs.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the nature of the demand for this workload.
- Deploy selected foundation model on acceptable
infrastructure, even if it may be over-provisioned.
- Establish an inference or demand profile for the hosted
workload.
- Optimize the hosting infrastructure in accordance with the
workload's demands, and select the most cost optimized
infrastructure that meets performance requirements.
