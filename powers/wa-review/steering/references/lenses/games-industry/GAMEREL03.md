# GAMEREL03-BP01 Monitor game server disruptions, and use the data to improve hosting architecture to achieve reliability goals

Monitor game server metrics and the impact of failures or
degradations in performance, such as increased latency under load,
on player behavior over time so that you can adjust your game
server hosting strategy to meet your game's reliability
requirements. Game server infrastructure to be degraded should be
removed from service immediately if it is impacting players or
proactively replaced when there are no active player sessions
hosted on the server.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

For scenarios where games are hosted as REST APIs, system
reliability can be managed like traditional web application
architectures, where traffic can be load balanced across multiple
servers in a distributed manner to mitigate the risk of server
failures.

For real-time synchronous gameplay, a game session is usually
hosted on a game server process running on a virtual machine, or
game server instance, since gameplay state needs to be maintained
in a performant manner and replicated to connected game clients.
This implementation means that a player's experience is tightly
coupled to the performance and reliability of the game server
process that hosts their game session. This type of architecture
makes managing the reliability of game servers more complex than
traditional approaches.

To mitigate the impact of a game server failure, configure your
game to continuously perform asynchronous updates of a player's
game state to a highly-available cache or database such
as [Amazon ElastiCache (Redis OSS)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/)
or [Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/). If a server failure occurs, the
player's last saved game state can be fetched from the external
data store, and their session can be restored on a new game server
instance.

However, this approach adds additional cost and complexity to
manage this external state, and may not be suitable for fast-paced
or competitive games where the state changes are so frequent and
happening at such a significant scale that introducing even a
performant in-memory cache data store would result in replication
lag that is too significant to be useful to restore a session
from. For games of this nature, the optimal approach is to accept
the loss of the server and send the player back to a game lobby to
find another session or you can automatically redirect them into
another game session.

Capture as much useful log data about what caused the server
disruption so that you can investigate the issue later. Amazon
GameLift provides guidance
for [debugging
fleet issues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html) and provides the ability
to [remotely
access Amazon GameLift fleet instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-remote-access.html) .

### Implementation steps

- Monitor game server metrics for performance degradations,
and remove or replace degraded servers as necessary to
maintain reliability.
- Use Amazon ElastiCache or MemoryDB for asynchronous game
state updates to enable session recovery after server
failures when feasible.
- Capture detailed log data on server disruptions for
investigation and debugging, leveraging tools like Amazon
GameLift for fleet monitoring and remote access.

# GAMEREL03-BP02 Implement loose coupling of game features to handle failures with minimal impact to player experience

Decoupling components refers to the concept of designing server
components so that they can operate as independently as possible.
Some aspects of gaming are difficult to decouple since data needs
to be as up to date as possible to provide a good in-game
experience for players. However, many components and gaming tasks
can be decoupled. For example, leaderboards and stats services are
not critical to the gameplay experience, and the reads and writes
to these services can be performed asynchronously from the game.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement graceful degradation for features in your game that can
be disabled automatically or by an administrator if issues are
detected, as well as configure upstream services that depend on
the feature to be able to gracefully handle the failure. For
example, if specific player data is not properly loading within
your game client, you should consider whether this data is
critical to the gameplay experience. If not, configure the game
client to gracefully handle this failure without disrupting the
experience for the player, optioning to retry fetching this data
later when the player revisits the screen.

Employ logic such as timeouts, retries, and backoff to handle
errors and failures. Timeouts keep systems from hanging for
unreasonably long periods. Retries can provide high availability
of transient and random errors.

Define non-critical components which can be loosely coupled to
critical components. Loose coupling allows systems to be more
resilient since failure in one component does not cascade to
others. When game features do not require stateful connections to
your game servers or backend, you should implement stateless
protocols to scale dynamically and recover from transient
failures. Develop your non-critical components where it can be
loosely coupled with stateless protocols using an HTTP/JSON API.
Implement network calls from the game client to be asynchronous
and non-blocking to minimize the impact to players from
slow-performing game features or other dependent services.

To further improve resiliency through loose coupling, use a
messaging service such as a queuing, streaming, or a topic-based
system between components that can be handled asynchronously. This
model is suitable for an interaction that does not require an
immediate response or where an acknowledgment that a request has
been registered is sufficient. This solution involves one
component that generates events and another that consumes them.
The two components will not integrate through direct
point-to-point interaction but through an intermediate such as a
durable storage or queuing layer. This also assists to improve
system's reliability by preserving messages when processing fails.

Research and select an appropriate messaging mechanism, as various
messaging services have different characteristics, such as
ordering and delivery mechanisms. Design operations to be
idempotent so the chosen message system delivers messages at least
once. As an example, consider a typical game use case where your
game needs to track player playtime, stats, or other relevant data
which can lead to a high write-throughput use case at times of
peak player concurrency.

To implement a reliable architecture, consider whether the use
case requires read-after-write consistency as perceived by the
player. Typically, scenarios such as these are suitable for
asynchronous processing and can be achieved by implementing a
write-queueing pattern where the requests are ingested into a
scalable and durable message queue such as Amazon SQS and can be
inserted into your backend database in batches using a consumer
service, such as a Lambda function. This approach is more reliable
than synchronous communication between multiple distributed
components including the player's game client, your backend web
and application servers, and your internal database system. It
also reduces costs because the backend database does not need to
be scaled to meet peak write throughput since the consumer
processing from the write queue can be used to slow down this
ingestion rate as needed.

### Implementation steps

- Decouple non-critical components like leaderboards and stats
services from critical gameplay features to allow
asynchronous operations and enhance resiliency.
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical features
with logic for timeouts, retries, and backoff, and verify
that the game client handles failures without disrupting the
player experience.
- Use messaging systems like Amazon SQS for asynchronous
communication between components, enabling scalable,
durable, and reliable processing of high throughput use
cases.

# GAMEREL03-BP03 Monitor infrastructure events over time to measure impact on player behavior

Monitor your game server process, game server instance metrics,
and game experience metrics to determine the root cause of issues.
In addition to monitoring CPU and memory, you can also set up
monitoring for network metrics related to network limitations of
EC2 instances to alert you of issues such as exceeding bandwidth,
packets-per-second, or other network-level issues that may
indicate your server resources are under provisioned.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Use CloudWatch Synthetics to check critical path application
functionality for player experience, such as being unable to login
or other service impacting issues. For game servers hosted using
Amazon GameLift, consider monitoring
[metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
like:

- GameServerInterruptions and InstanceInterruptions, which can
assist in understanding how limitations in Spot instance
availability are impacting your game servers deployed using
Spot.
- ServerProcessAbnormalTerminations, which can be used to detect
abnormal terminations in your game server processes.

It is recommended to maintain historical metrics data of your game
server reliability. Use this historical data for reporting
purposes and join it with other datasets to uncover potential
trends and assess the impact on player behavior over time that may
be due to game server issues.

Amazon CloudWatch does not retain metrics indefinitely, and
the [storage
resolution of metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html) is increased over time, so consider
exporting these metrics to cost-effective long-term storage such
as Amazon S3. You can
configure [CloudWatch
Metric Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time/) to automatically deliver your metrics from
[CloudWatch
Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Cross-Account-Methods.html) to your own S3 bucket, where they can be stored
long-term in a storage tier such as S3 Intelligent-Tiering and
eventually archived using Amazon Glacier. By placing your
metrics in Amazon S3, they are readily available to be joined with
other datasets in your data lake for interactive querying
with [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).

### Implementation steps

- Monitor game server, instance, and network metrics,
including bandwidth and packet-per-second limits, using
Amazon CloudWatch and CloudWatch Synthetics for critical
path functionality checks.
- Track GameLift-specific metrics like
*GameServerInterruptions* and
*ServerProcessAbnormalTerminations* to
assess the impact of Spot instance availability and detect
abnormal server terminations.
- Export CloudWatch metrics to Amazon S3 for long-term
storage, use cost-effective tiers like S3
Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier, and analyze trends with
tools like Amazon Athena.
