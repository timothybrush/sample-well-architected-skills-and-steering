# Definition

There are three best practice areas for operational excellence
in the cloud:

- Prepare
- Operate
- Evolve

Operations teams need to understand their business and customer
needs so that they can effectively and efficiently support
business outcomes. Operations creates and uses procedures to
respond to operational events and validates their effectiveness
to support business needs. Operations collects metrics that are
used to measure the achievement of desired business outcomes.
Everything continues to change—your business context, business
priorities, customer needs, etc. It’s important to design
operations to support evolution over time in response to change
and to incorporate lessons learned through their performance.

SaaS OPS 1: How are you able to effectively monitor and manage
the operational health of a multi-tenant environment?

In multi-tenant environments, where all of an organization’s
customers might be deployed in a shared infrastructure model,
the need for a more detailed operational view of health is
often essential to the success and growth and of a SaaS
business. Any outage or health issue has the potential of
cascading across all the tenants of your system and taking a
SaaS service down for all customers. This means that SaaS
organizations must place a premium on creating an operational
experience that will enable operations teams to effectively
analyze and respond to continually shifting workloads of a
SaaS environment.

Building a robust multi-tenant operational experience requires
SaaS companies to create or customize tooling to introduce the
more granular views of health and activity that are needed in
a SaaS environment. This often means using a combination of
existing tools and custom solutions to create an experience
that supports tenancy and tenant tiers as first-class concepts
within the operational experience.

A SaaS operations dashboard, for example, should include views
of health that are presented through the lens of tenants and
tenant tiers. While viewing the global view of health is still
part of this experience, a SaaS operations team also needs the
ability to see the health and activity of tenants. The diagram
in Figure 12 provides a conceptual view of one way a SaaS
provider might surface tenant activity as a first-class
construct.

The simplified view in this diagram highlights a few samples
of operational views that would add value in multi-tenant
environment. At the top-left of the page, you’ll see a view of
health for the most active tenants. The color indicators shown
could focus attention to tenants that might be experiencing
issues that, when looking at a global view of health, have not
been surfaced. This allows operations to react and respond
proactively to any issues that might not be entirely apparent
to a tenant.

*Figure 12: Tenant-aware operations views*
In the top-right of this view, you’ll see data on tenant
resource consumption. The idea here is to view consumption of
AWS resources on a tenant-by-tenant basis, allowing you to see
how particular tenants are exercising specific services. At
the bottom, you’ll see a view of consumption that illustrates
how tenants are consuming the various microservices of your
application. The data here lets operations have views into how
tenants are consuming the various services of your system and
determine if a particular tenant or tier might be saturating a
particular microservice.

In addition to providing this general view of tenant activity,
your operational experience should also include the ability to
drill into the operational data for individual tenants and
tiers. Imagine support scenarios where a specific tenant or
tenant tier is experiencing issues. In these cases, you’ll
want to be able to access operational data and view it through
the lens of that particular tenant or tier. This is essential
to being able to troubleshoot and diagnose issues in a
multi-tenant setting.

Creating these operational views relies on having access to
operational data that includes the tenant and tiering context
that’s required to create the operational views that can
analyze insights by tenant or tenant tier. This requires SaaS
architects to give care consideration to how and where they
can inject tenant context into the various mechanisms that are
used to record health and activity events. For example, logs
should include mechanisms to ensure that tenant context (such
as tenant identifier and tier) are injected into your system’s
log data.

The views that you choose to construct, however, will vary
based on the nature of your application’s design and
architecture. Generally, teams should be thinking about the
operational views that will enable operations teams to
effectively monitor tenant trends and build the
instrumentation into their environments from the outset.
Adding these concepts into your application later in your
development process is more challenging and will likely
undermine both development and operational experiences.
Note
The numbering of the questions in this whitepaper has been changed to match the
order in the SaaS Lens of the [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/). **SaaS OPS 2** is described in the
following best practice, [Evolve](./oe-evolve.html).

SaaS OPS 3: How are new tenants onboarded to your system?

SaaS solutions are highly focused on maximizing agility and
innovation. Tenant onboarding plays a key role in this agility
story. By creating an architecture that promotes a
frictionless, repeatable onboarding process, SaaS
organizations are able to streamline, optimize, and scale
their ability to introduce new tenants into their SaaS
environment. This enables SaaS companies to support rapid
growth and offer customers an experience the accelerates their
overall time to value.

It’s important to note that automated onboarding applies to
both B2C and B2B SaaS environments. While some SaaS offerings
might not include a self-service onboarding experience, this
does not reduce the need for a frictionless onboarding
experience. Even when onboarding is an internally executed
process, it should still automate all the elements of tenant
creation. The need for reduced friction is foundational to
creating a solution that aligns with SaaS best practices.

Generally, the onboarding process for a SaaS application
requires the orchestration of a series of shared services that
can configure and provision all the resources needed to
introduce a new tenant. The diagram in Figure 13 provides a
high-level view of how you could implement this onboarding via
a series of microservices.

The flow of the onboarding experience represented in this
diagram covers all the steps needed to introduce a tenant and
have them begin using your SaaS system. At the front of this
process, a tenant calls our registration service requesting to
create a new tenant. From this point forward, the registration
service will then sit at the middle of the onboarding process,
orchestrating all the services needed to create the new tenant
environment.

The next step in this process is to create a new user. This
new user will represent the administrator for this new tenant.
To support this process, we’ve included a user management
service. This service doesn’t hold data about the user, but it
creates the user in an identity provider (in this case Amazon Cognito). It also creates any IAM policies that are needed to
support the isolation requirements of this tenant.

*Figure 13: Frictionless tenant onboarding*
In this model, we’ve also relied on a strategy that use a
separate Amazon Cognito user pool for each tenant. This allows
us to customize the identity experience for each tenant of our
system (password policies, multi-factor authentication, etc.).
By selecting this approach, we must map each user ID to a
corresponding user pool. This mapping is managed by the user
management service.

After the user is created, our process now creates a tenant.
This separation of tenant as a distinct service is essential
to SaaS environments. It provides a centralized way to manage
the state and attributes of a tenant completely separate from
the users that are associated with that tenant. A tenant’s
tier or the status, for example, would be controlled by the
tenant management service.

As part of onboarding, a SaaS system must often establish a
footprint in a billing system. In this example, you’ll see
that we inform the billing integration service that we’re
creating a new tenant. This service then assumes
responsibility for creating a new account with the billing
provider. This includes configuring the plan or tier for the
tenant (free, bronze, platinum, etc.).

The last step in the process shown in the diagram relates to
the provisioning of tenant infrastructure. Some SaaS
architectures will include dedicated tenant resources. In
these scenarios, our onboarding process must provision these
new resources before our tenant can be activated.

While the flow represented here could vary depending on the
nature of your environment, the concepts represented here are
common to the onboarding process. Automating the creation,
configuration, and provisioning of tenant resources is
fundamental to creating a rich, scalable multi-tenant
experience.

SaaS OPS 4: How do you support the need for tenant-specific
customizations?

One of the significant challenges SaaS architects face is the
need to ensure that all tenants are running the same version
of their product. This is especially true for companies that
have migrated to SaaS and have grown accustomed to supporting
unique customer requirements through one-off versions of their
product.

While this might seem tempting, any movement away from a
unified customer management, operations, support, and
deployment experience directly undermines the overall agility
of a SaaS organization. As each new custom environment is
introduced, a SaaS organization slowly makes its way to a
traditional software model. Ultimately, this ends up eroding
the cost, operational efficiency, and general innovation goals
that are core the SaaS business model.

The challenge, then, is to find a strategy that allows you to
meet these occasional one-off needs without creating a forked
version of your product. The compromise here is achieved
through the introduction of customization options that are
added to the overall offering. So, instead of spinning off a
separate version, you’d invest the extra time and effort into
figuring out how these new features can be added in a way that
makes them available to *all* customers.
Then, through tenant configuration, you can determine which
tenants will have these new capabilities enabled.

A common approach to this problem is to use feature flags.
Feature flags are commonly used by application developers as a
way to have multiple paths of execution in a common code base
with flags that enable or disable each of the different
capabilities at runtime. This technique, which is often used
as a general development strategy, provides an effective way
to introduce customization into your SaaS environment. Each
feature flag would correlate to a tenant configuration option.
This configuration would be evaluated at runtime and influence
the features that are enabled for each tenant.

The diagram in Figure 14 provides a conceptual view of how
these flags would be applied. A series of flags will be turned
on and off for individual tenants, determining which
capabilities are enabled for a tenant. These configuration
options would be changed as a tenant signs up for new features
of a SaaS offering. In some cases, these flags can be
associated with tiers (instead of individual tenants).

*Figure 14: Managing tenant needs with feature flags*
Feature flags are just one way to achieve this. The key
takeaway here is that—even if a single tenant needs a unique
feature—that feature should be introduced as a customization
to the core platform. How you apply that customization can
vary based on the stack and design of your system. The intent
is to ensure that we can deploy and manage a single version of
our product.

While this can be a powerful construct, it should be applied
with caution. If, by introducing feature flags, you create a
complex maze of options that end up presenting every tenant a
unique experience, your system will quickly become
unmanageable. Try to be selective about how and when you
introduce these flags. As a rule of thumb, the business should
not see this as a sales tool that enables the organization to
offer one-off customizations to new customers.

# Evolve

SaaS OPS 2: How are you capturing and surfacing metric data that can be used
to analyze the usage and consumption trends of individual tenants?

To continually evolve your SaaS operations experience, you’ll
need to have access to a rich collection of operational data
that can be used to analyze your multi-tenant SaaS
environment. This often means instrumenting and publishing a
much richer collection of tenant metrics from your application
that can accurately capture the activity and consumption
patterns of the tenants that are exercising your environment.

SaaS metrics go beyond the fundamental of infrastructure
consumption (CPU, memory, etc.), identifying specific
operational usage patterns that are fundamental to
understanding the operation of multi-tenant loads in your
environment. Analysis of this data will allow SaaS
organizations to assess trends that are happening across their
system and identify opportunities to introduce policies or
changes to the underlying architecture that will continually
improve the reliability, scalability, cost efficiency, and
overall agility of a SaaS offering.

There are two distinct elements of capturing and surfacing
metric data. First, your application must publish the metric
data that can provide useful operational insights into your
SaaS environment. You’ll need to identify key points in your
application where you’ll want to capture and publish these
metrics.

The other piece of the puzzle here is the ingestion,
aggregation, and surfacing of this data. There is a wide
spectrum of tools that you can choose here from AWS or one of
the AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners. Ultimately, the
ingestion component of this becomes more of a data warehouse
and business intelligence question. The SaaS architecture
scenarios listed previously in this document includes a Tenant
Insights scenario. This scenario outlines an architecture for
ingesting metric data. That architecture represents one of the
patterns you can apply to address this need.

While our focus here is on the operational view of these
tenant metrics, you can imagine that these metrics have usage
in multiple contexts across a SaaS business. The operational
requirement is for your architecture to ensure that the
organization is actively collecting and analyzing tenant
activity and consumption trends to identify opportunities to
evolve your SaaS system. This fits with the broader theme of
building the foundational tooling that can be used to assess
the continually shifting mix of tenants and tenant workloads.
