# TELCOOPS08-BP01 Develop and execute comprehensive failure testing programs that reflect cloud infrastructure characteristics

ISVs and CSPs should adapt their testing approaches to account for cloud infrastructure
characteristics that differ from on-premises environments. This includes developing
comprehensive failure testing programs that simulate various network and infrastructure
failures, implementing chaos engineering practices, and using tools like AWS Fault Injection Service to
test system resilience. Tests should go beyond basic instance or pod failures to include network
impairments, Availability Zone failures, and other realistic failure scenarios that could impact
telecommunication services.

**Desired outcome:**

- Comprehensive failure testing.
- Validated resilience measures.
- Identified weaknesses.
- Improved recovery procedures.
- Verified failover capabilities.
- Enhanced system reliability.

**Comment anti-patterns:**

- Limited test scenarios
- Unrealistic test conditions
- Missing failure scenarios
- Poor test documentation
- Inadequate recovery testing
- No regular testing schedule
- Incomplete impact analysis

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Design and implement a systematic failure testing program that validates system
resilience across critical components and services. Create a comprehensive test matrix that
includes various failure scenarios, from individual component failures to complete zone or
regional outages, while considering cloud-specific characteristics and behaviors. Implement
automated testing frameworks that can safely simulate failures and validate recovery
procedures without risking production workloads. Establish detailed monitoring and analysis
procedures to capture test results, identify improvement areas, and track the evolution of
system reliability over time.

### Implementation steps

- Use AWS Fault Injection Service for controlled chaos experiments and AWS Systems Manager for test automation.
- Deploy AWS Step Functions for orchestrating test scenarios an d AWS Lambda for test execution.
- Implement Amazon EventBridge for test scheduling and AWS Systems Manager Automation for test procedures.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch for test result collection and Amazon OpenSearch Service for test data analysis.
- Configure AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter for test management and AWS CloudTrail for test activity
logging.
