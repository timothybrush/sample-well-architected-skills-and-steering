# TELCOCOST02-BP01 Implement dynamic CNF sizing and scaling strategies based on actual subscriber demands and usage patterns

In traditional on-premises environments, CNF infrastructure is typically sized for peak
capacity expected over the hardware lifetime. To optimize costs in cloud environments,
organizations should implement dynamic sizing strategies that align infrastructure capacity with
actual subscriber demands. This includes utilizing cloud-based auto scaling capabilities,
implementing rightsizing based on usage patterns, and designing CNF architectures that support
horizontal scaling. The approach should balance performance requirements with cost efficiency
while maintaining the ability to handle growth in subscriber demand through elastic
infrastructure scaling.

**Desired outcome:**

- Optimize the cost of your cloud-based network functions (CNFs) by right-sizing
resources based on actual usage.
- Verify CNF performance meets service-level objectives while minimizing
over-provisioning.
- Achieve cost savings by dynamically scaling CNF resources up and down in response to
changing demand.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Static, one-size-fits-all provisioning of CNF resources without considering variable
demand.
- Over-provisioning of CNF resources to handle peak capacity, leading to excess costs
during off-peak periods.
- Lack of visibility into CNF resource utilization and performance, hindering effective
scaling decisions.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Significant cost savings by aligning CNF resources with actual subscriber needs.
- Improved CNF performance and reliability by adapting to changing demand patterns.
- Enhanced operational efficiency through automated scaling and resource management.
- Increased agility in responding to growth or seasonal fluctuations in subscriber base.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Implementing dynamic sizing and scaling strategies for your cloud-based Network Functions
(CNFs) is crucial for optimizing costs in a cloud-based telco environment. Unlike traditional
on-premises deployments, the cloud provides the opportunity to right-size your CNF resources
based on actual subscriber demands and usage patterns, rather than provisioning peak capacity.

By using cloud-based auto scaling capabilities, you can dynamically adjust the
resources allocated to your CNFs, verifying performance requirements are met while minimizing
over-provisioning and associated costs. This approach allows you to scale resources up and
down in response to changes in subscriber demand, improving cost-efficiency without
compromising the user experience.

### Implementation steps

- Profile the performance and resource utilization characteristics of your cloud-based network functions (CNFs).
- Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically scale CNF resources up and down based on
real-time metrics like CPU, memory, and network utilization.
- Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms to trigger auto scaling actions when thresholds are
breached.
- Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups with a dynamic target tracking scaling policy to maintain
optimal performance at the lowest cost.
- Analyze historical usage patterns and seasonality to set appropriate scaling
thresholds and policies.
- Continuously monitor and refine your autoscaling configurations to verify they
adapt to changing traffic patterns.

# TELCOCOST02-BP02 Choose the most efficient compute resource for your Network Function

When implementing cloud-based network functions (CNFs), it is important to benchmark your
applications on different compute types to determine the optimal balance of performance and
cost-efficiency. CNFs have diverse compute requirements, so gravitating to the lowest cost
option may result in poor performance. Older compute architectures and hardware can hamper
efficiency and drive-up expenses over time.

**Desired outcome:**

- Identify the most cost-effective compute resources that meet the performance
requirements of your cloud-based network functions (CNFs).
- Optimize the balance between cost and performance for your CNF workloads.
- Avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning of compute resources, which can lead to
increased costs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Selecting compute resources solely based on the lowest cost, without considering
performance requirements.
- Relying on outdated compute architectures and hardware that are less efficient and
cost-effective.
- Lack of benchmarking and profiling of CNF workloads on different compute options.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Significant cost savings by selecting the most optimal compute resources for your CNFs.
- Improved CNF performance and reliability by matching compute capabilities to workload
needs.
- Enhanced operational efficiency by right-sizing compute resources to avoid
over-provisioning.
- Increased agility in responding to changing compute requirements for your CNF
workloads.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

When implementing cloud-based network functions (CNFs), it is crucial to carefully
evaluate the compute resource options to strike the right balance between cost and
performance. CNFs often have diverse compute requirements, and simply selecting the
lowest-cost compute option may result in poor performance and sub-optimal outcomes.

By benchmarking your CNF applications on different compute types, you can identify the
most efficient resources that meet your performance needs. This may involve evaluating various
AWS compute services, such as Amazon EC2 instances with different processor architectures, memory
configurations, and storage options. Older compute architectures and hardware can also hamper
efficiency and drive-up expenses over time, so it is important to consider the long-term costs
and benefits of your compute choices.

The goal is to optimize the cost-performance tradeoff for your CNF workloads, verifying
you are not over-provisioning or under-provisioning compute resources, which can lead to
increased costs.

### Implementation steps

- Profile the performance and resource utilization characteristics of your
cloud-based network functions (CNFs).
- Benchmark your CNF applications on a variety of AWS compute instances, including
different processor architectures, memory configurations, and storage options.
- Analyze the performance and cost data to identify the most efficient compute
resources that meet your CNF's requirements.
- Consider the long-term implications of your compute choices, evaluating factors
like energy efficiency, hardware lifecycle, and future performance trends.
- Implement mechanisms to dynamically adjust the compute resources allocated to your
CNFs based on changing demands and workload characteristics.
- Continuously monitor and optimize your CNF compute resource allocations to verify
cost-effectiveness while maintaining performance.
