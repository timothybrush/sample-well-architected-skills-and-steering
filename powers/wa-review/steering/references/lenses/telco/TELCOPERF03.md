# TELCOPERF03-BP01 Implement dedicated network infrastructure for control and user plane functions

Separating network infrastructure for control and user plane functions (CUPS) is essential
for optimizing telco workload performance. Control plane infrastructure should be designed with
high availability and security features to handle signaling traffic effectively, while user
plane infrastructure must be optimized for high throughput and low latency to manage subscriber
data. This separation enables independent scaling of each plane based on specific requirements
while maintaining secure and efficient inter-plane communication, leading to better resource
utilization and improved service quality.

**Desired outcome:**

- Separate the network infrastructure for control plane and user plane functions to
enhance performance and scalability.
- Verify the control plane infrastructure is designed for high availability and security
to handle signaling traffic effectively.
- Optimize the user plane infrastructure for high throughput and low latency to manage
subscriber data efficiently.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Deploying control plane and user plane functions on a shared network infrastructure
without separation.
- Failing to consider the distinct performance and scaling requirements of the Control
and User Plane components.
- Neglecting to design the appropriate high availability and security mechanisms for the
control plane network.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Improved overall network performance and service quality by optimizing the control and
user plane components independently.
- Enhanced scalability and the ability to scale each plane based on specific requirements.
- Increased security and reliability of the control plane functions through dedicated
network infrastructure.
- Better resource utilization and cost optimization by aligning the network
infrastructure with the distinct needs of each plane.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Separating the network infrastructure for control plane and user plane functions (CUPS)
is a critical best practice for optimizing the performance and scalability of telco workloads.
This architectural approach recognizes the distinct requirements and characteristics of these
two fundamental components of telco networks.

The control plane infrastructure should be designed with high availability and security
features to handle the signaling traffic and control-related functions effectively. This
includes maintaining robust failover mechanisms, efficient load balancing, and advanced
security measures to protect the critical control plane elements.

In contrast, the user plane infrastructure must be optimized for high throughput and low
latency to manage the subscriber data and user traffic efficiently. This may involve the use
of specialized hardware acceleration solutions, such as SmartNICs and FPGAs, to offload
intensive packet processing tasks and improve overall network performance.

By implementing this separation of the control and user plane networks, telco operators
can scale each plane independently based on their specific requirements, leading to better
resource utilization and improved service quality. This approach also enables more efficient
inter-plane communication, as the dedicated network infrastructure can be tailored to the
needs of each component.

When deploying this best practice, telco operators should consider the overall network
architecture, the expected traffic patterns, and the specific performance and scaling
requirements of the control and user plane functions. This may involve the use of services
like AWS Wavelength or AWS Local Zones to strategically place the user plane components closer
to the end users for reduced latency.

### Implementation steps

- Create separate VPCs within your AWS environment to host the control plane and
user plane components, configuring appropriate subnets, routing tables, and security
groups for each.
- Establish secure communication between the control plane and user plane VPCs using
AWS PrivateLink, AWS Transit Gateway, or Site-to-Site VPN connections.
- Configure AWS Direct Connect or AWS Outposts to provide dedicated, high-bandwidth network
connectivity for the user plane infrastructure, optimizing for low-latency and
high-throughput.
- Use AWS Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic across the user plane
components, and AWS Application Load Balancer to manage the control signaling traffic for the Control
Plane.
- Implement Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the performance, security, and health
of the separated control plane and user plane network infrastructure.

# TELCOPERF03-BP02 Deploy hardware acceleration solutions for enhanced packet processing and network performance

Implementing hardware acceleration solutions such as SmartNICs and FPGAs is crucial for
meeting the demanding performance requirements of modern telco workloads. These solutions

# TELCOPERF03-BP03 Implement network timing synchronization and distribution mechanisms to verify service consistency

Establishing robust network timing synchronization across distributed infrastructure is
critical for maintaining consistent service quality in telco workloads. Proper timing mechanisms
verify smooth handovers, accurate billing, and reliable service delivery, particularly in edge
computing scenarios. Deploy timing solutions that comply with 3GPP specifications and support

## Implementation guidance

Establishing robust network timing synchronization across the distributed telco
infrastructure is critical for maintaining consistent service quality and reliability. Proper
timing mechanisms verify smooth handovers, accurate billing, and reliable service delivery,
particularly in edge computing scenarios where network elements may be geographically
dispersed.

telco operators should deploy timing solutions that comply with 3GPP specifications and
support future network evolution, such as the transition to 5G. These solutions should be able
to provide precise synchronization between network elements at different locations,
considering the geographic distribution of the infrastructure and the need for accurate
timestamping of network events.

By implementing a comprehensive network timing synchronization and distribution strategy,
telco operators can verify that critical services like voice, video, and real-time data
processing are delivered with consistent quality, and that billing and charging processes are
accurate and reliable. This level of timing precision is essential for maintaining a seamless
user experience and complying with industry standards and regulations.

When designing the network timing architecture, telco operators should consider factors
such as the geographic spread of their infrastructure, the specific requirements of their
telco services, and the compatibility with existing and emerging network protocols and
standards. This may involve the use of dedicated timing distribution mechanisms, such as IEEE
1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) or Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies,
to verify accurate and reliable time synchronization across the network**.**

### Implementation steps

- Use AWS Outposts to deploy on-premises network equipment that supports precision
timing protocols like IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS).
- Configure AWS Wavelength Zones to provide the necessary timing synchronization and
distribution capabilities for your telco workloads deployed at the network edge.
- Leverage AWS Ground Station, a fully managed satellite ground station service, to
access GNSS timing data and distribute it to your telco network components across
different Regions.
- Implement Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the performance and reliability of the
network timing synchronization, triggering alerts and automated responses for deviations
from the expected behavior.
