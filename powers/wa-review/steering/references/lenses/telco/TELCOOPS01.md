# TELCOOPS01-BP01 Promote cross-functional collaboration across internal and external stakeholders

Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, to
determine where to focus efforts on external and internal goals. Identify long-term and
short-term goals which assist to prioritize tasks with added efficiency. Encourage collaboration
between different teams, such as network engineers, cloud architects, ISV architects and
security experts, to verify efficient communication and knowledge sharing across the
organization.

**Desired outcome:**

- Established cross-functional teams with clear roles and responsibilities.
- Improved communication and collaboration between network, cloud, security, and business
teams.
- Aligned short-term and long-term goals across different stakeholder groups.
- Enhanced decision-making through diverse expertise and perspectives.
- Faster problem resolution and innovation cycles.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Siloed teams working in isolation without regular interaction.
- Lack of shared goals and metrics across teams.
- Communication barriers between technical and business stakeholders.
- Insufficient involvement of security and compliance-aligned teams in preliminary stages.
- No clear escalation paths for cross-team issues.
- Collaboration without structured processes.
- Missing documentation of decisions and rationales.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Creating effective cross-functional teams requires a structured approach that balances
organizational needs with individual expertise. Begin by establishing clear team charters that
define the scope, objectives, and decision-making authority for each cross-functional group.
Implement regular synchronization mechanisms such as daily stand-ups, weekly coordination
meetings, and monthly strategic reviews to verify continuous alignment across teams. Create
standardized communication channels and documentation practices that enable transparent
information sharing while maintaining clear escalation paths for critical issues. Consider
using agile methodologies adapted for telecommunications environments to improve collaboration
efficiency and response times to changing requirements.

### Implementation steps

- Use AWS Organizations to create organizational units (OUs) that reflect team structures, and
AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized access management and role-based permissions.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter for centralized operations management and integrate
collaboration tools through Amazon EventBridge for automated notifications.
- Use Service Catalog to standardize approved services and configurations across teams, with
AWS tags for resource tracking and ownership.
- Deploy AWS Systems Manager Change Manager for standardized change processes and Amazon CloudWatch
for automated operational dashboards.
- Use AWS Systems Manager Automation for process standardization and AWS Config for
resource monitoring.

# TELCOOPS01-BP02 Evaluate your governance and regulatory requirements

Systematically assess and verify telco governance frameworks, regulatory mandates, and
security requirements across network operations. This includes evaluating legal intercept
capabilities, security controls, and industry-specific regulations while maintaining
documentation of assessment activities and findings. Regular evaluation verifies continued
alignment with evolving regulatory landscapes and identify gaps that require remediation.

**Desired outcome:**

- Comprehensive understanding of regulatory requirements.
- Clear governance frameworks aligned with industry standards.
- Documented controls and procedures.
- Regular assessment and verification processes.
- Traceability of activities.
- Proactive identification of regulatory changes.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Reactive approach to requirements.
- Incomplete documentation of regulatory obligations.
- Missing or outdated controls.
- No regular assessments.
- Lack of monitoring tools.
- Insufficient training on regulatory requirements.
- Random governance processes.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish a comprehensive governance framework that addresses both industry-specific
regulations and organizational policies. Create a systematic approach for identifying,
documenting, and tracking regulatory requirements using a centralized management system that
maintains status and upcoming changes. Implement regular assessment cycles that include both
internal audits and external validations to verify continued adherance with telecommunications
regulations and standards. Develop a robust documentation system that maintains evidence of
activities, including regular testing of controls, training records, and audit trails for
regulatory reporting.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy AWS Audit Manager to evaluate adherence with regulatory standards and
AWS Config to assess resource configurations against rules.
- Implement AWS Control Tower for multi-account governance and AWS Organizations for policy
management through Service Control Policies (SCPs).
- Configure AWS Security Hub CSPM for centralized security monitoring and AWS CloudTrail for
comprehensive API activity logging.
- Use AWS Systems Manager Documents to create standardized procedures and AWS
IAM Access Analyzer for continuous permission validation.
- Deploy Amazon EventBridge for automated checks and AWS Config Rules for ongoing configuration
assessment.

# TELCOOPS01-BP03 Evaluate tradeoffs and threats while managing benefits and risks for telecommunication workloads

Conduct comprehensive analysis of benefits, risks, and tradeoffs associated with telco
workloads to make informed architectural and operational decisions. This involves evaluating
multiple dimensions including technical capabilities, security implications, vendor
relationships, and organizational impact. The assessment should balance immediate operational
needs with long-term strategic objectives while considering security threats, technological
maturity, and cross-functional requirements.

**Desired outcome:**

- Balanced risk-benefit analysis framework.
- Clear understanding of technical and operational tradeoffs.
- Documented threat assessment methodology.
- Risk mitigation strategies.
- Quantified impact analysis.
- Strategic alignment with business objectives.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Making decisions without proper risk analysis.
- Ignoring technical debt implications.
- Lack of threat modeling.
- Insufficient stakeholder input in risk decisions.
- No documented decision criteria.
- Overlooking long-term consequences.
- Missing risk registers.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Develop a structured risk assessment framework that considers both technical and business
impacts of architectural decisions in telecommunications environments. Implement a systematic
approach to threat modeling that includes regular security assessments, vulnerability
scanning, and penetration testing to identify potential risks early in the development cycle.
Create a decision-making framework that weighs multiple factors including performance
requirements, security implications, operational overhead, and cost considerations to verify
balanced outcomes. Establish regular review cycles to reassess previous decisions and adjust
strategies based on changing threat landscapes and business requirements.

### Implementation steps

- Create a standardized methodology for evaluating risks, threats, and opportunities
across telecommunication workloads.
- Conduct comprehensive threat modeling and vulnerability assessments with documented
mitigation strategies.
- Establish quantifiable metrics for evaluating potential benefits and ROI of
architectural decisions and operational changes.
- Implement structured decision frameworks with clear evaluation criteria and
approval workflows.
- Establish regular review cycles to assess the effectiveness of decisions and adjust
