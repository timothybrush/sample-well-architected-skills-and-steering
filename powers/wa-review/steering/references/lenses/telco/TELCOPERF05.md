# TELCOPERF05-BP01 Implement data lifecycle management strategies for IVR and call logs to optimize storage costs and performance

Implementing effective data lifecycle management for Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
systems and call logs is crucial in telecommunications environments. This strategy involves
categorizing data based on access patterns, regulatory requirements, and business value, then
moving it through different storage tiers to balance performance and cost-effectiveness. By
automating the transition of data from high-performance storage for frequently accessed records
to more cost-effective archival solutions for older data, telecommunications providers can
maintain optimal system performance while managing storage costs efficiently.

**Desired outcome:**

- Categorize telco data (for example, IVR recordings and call logs) based on access
patterns, regulatory requirements, and business value.
- Implement automated data lifecycle management to transition data between different
storage tiers, balancing performance, and cost-effectiveness.
- Maintain optimal system performance for frequently accessed data while managing
long-term storage costs efficiently.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Storing telco data on high-performance storage without considering lifecycle and access
patterns.
- Failing to implement data tiering and archiving strategies to manage the growing volume
of data.
- Neglecting to align data retention policies with regulatory requirements and business
needs.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Reduced storage costs by moving less frequently accessed data to more economical
storage solutions.
- Improved system performance and responsiveness for applications that rely on real-time
access to telco data.
- Adherence with industry regulations and internal data retention policies through
automated data lifecycle management.
- Enhanced operational efficiency by automating the movement and management of telco data
across storage tiers.
- Better utilization of storage resources through rightsizing and optimizing the storage
footprint.

## Implementation guidance

Implementing effective data lifecycle management for Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
systems and call logs is crucial in telecommunications environments. This strategy involves
categorizing data based on access patterns, regulatory requirements, and business value, then
moving it through different storage tiers to balance performance and cost-effectiveness.

By automating the transition of data from high-performance storage for frequently
accessed records to more cost-effective archival solutions for older data, telecommunications
providers can maintain optimal system performance while managing storage costs efficiently.
This approach verifies that mission-critical data, such as recent call logs and IVR
recordings, are readily available in high-performance storage, while historical data that is
less frequently accessed is stored in a more cost-effective manner.

When implementing this best practice, telco operators should consider the specific
retention requirements for different types of telco data, as defined by industry regulations
and internal policies. The data lifecycle management strategy should be designed to
automatically move data between storage tiers based on these retention policies, minimizing
the risk of data loss or unauthorized access.

Additionally, telco operators should integrate the data lifecycle management processes
with their broader data management and analytics workflows. This allows the insights gained
from analyzing telco data to inform the optimization of the storage strategy and the
categorization of data into appropriate tiers.

### Implementation steps

- Use Amazon S3 to store the different types of telco data (for example, IVR recordings,
call logs and billing records), categorizing them into appropriate S3 buckets based on
access patterns, regulatory requirements, and business value.
- Configure S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition data between S3 storage
classes, such as moving older data from S3 Standard to Amazon Glacier or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive, based on the defined data retention policies.
- Integrate Amazon EFS and Amazon EBS to provide high-performance file storage and block
storage for the frequently accessed telco data, complementing the long-term archival
capabilities of S3.
- Use AWS Storage Gateway to seamlessly connect your on-premises telco infrastructure with
the appropriate AWS storage services, enabling a hybrid storage architecture that
optimizes for performance and cost.
- Implement Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the data lifecycle management processes,
triggering alerts and automated actions for deviations from the defined policies.
