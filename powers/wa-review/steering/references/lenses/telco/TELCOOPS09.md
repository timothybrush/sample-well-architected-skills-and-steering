# TELCOOPS09-BP01 Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and baseline testing that accounts for shared infrastructure characteristics

To address the challenges of performance baselining in cloud environments with shared
resources (like Nitro-based instances), organizations should implement comprehensive monitoring
and testing strategies that account for various load conditions. This includes monitoring
instance-level metrics, understanding resource allocation limits, and conducting performance
tests under different multi-tenant scenarios. Organizations should also leverage available
performance metrics and tools to understand resource utilization patterns and verify accurate
capacity planning that accounts for shared infrastructure characteristics.

**Desired outcome:**

- Accurate performance baselines.
- Reliable capacity planning.
- Comprehensive monitoring.
- Performance predictability.
- Resource optimization.
- Early issue detection.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Inconsistent performance metrics.
- Missing baseline data.
- Poor monitoring coverage.
- Inadequate testing scenarios.
- No consideration of multi-tenancy.
- Unrealistic benchmarks.
- Lack of historical analysis.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
High

## Implementation guidance

Establish a holistic performance monitoring framework that accounts for the unique
characteristics of shared cloud infrastructure and telecommunication workloads. Develop
comprehensive baseline testing procedures that capture performance metrics across different
load conditions, time periods, and infrastructure configurations to create reliable
performance profiles. Implement continuous monitoring solutions that track key performance
indicators while accounting for multi-tenant impacts and resource contention scenarios. Create
analysis frameworks that combine historical trends, real-time metrics, and predictive
analytics to enable proactive performance optimization and capacity planning.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy Amazon CloudWatch for metric collection and Amazon Managed Grafana for visualization.
- Configure AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus for metric storage.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics for performance testing and AWS Lambda for custom test
execution.
- Implement Amazon OpenSearch Service for log analytics and Quick for performance analytics.
- Deploy AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter for performance issue management and AWS Compute Optimizer for
resource optimization.
