# TELCOREL01-BP01 Conduct regular load and failure tests to validate resilience on node, interface, and infrastructure levels

Implement a comprehensive testing strategy that evaluates network resilience through
simulated failures of nodes, interfaces, and infrastructure components. This includes testing in
both lower environments and production during maintenance windows to identify potential
weaknesses, validate redundancy measures, and verify recovery procedures. The testing should
cover both individual component failures and complex failure scenarios that could impact network
services.

**Desired outcomes**

- Identify single points of failure in terms of critical nodes and interfaces that, if
they fail, could impact network availability.
- Evaluate network resilience measures and ability to continue providing services to the
end user in case of multiple failure scenarios.
- To identify potential performance degradations that may arise due to increased traffic
loads.
- Verify effectiveness of redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- Document system behavior and recovery patterns.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

It is essential to regularly test and validate the system's ability to withstand
failures, maintaining a reliable and resilient telecom network. This includes defining the
test scenarios that cover both network function, interfaces and infrastructure-level failures.
Automate the testing and monitoring processes utilizing fault and traffic simulator functions.
Define clear success criteria, measurement metrics, and standard documentation practices, to
analyze the test results and identify patterns and vulnerabilities. By proactively validating
the network's ability to withstand and recover from various failure scenarios, CSPs can verify
continuous service availability and meet regulatory requirements for reliability.

### Implementation steps

- Define test scenarios for both network function and infrastructure failures:

For the network function connectivity failures, Amazon CloudWatch can be used to
monitor connectivity, latency, and error rates for your network interfaces and
connections.
- For infrastructure failures, you could leverage Amazon CloudWatch to track the metrics
and alarms on your critical AWS resources like EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and
network interfaces.

- Create inventory of critical components:

Use AWS Config to maintain a comprehensive inventory of your AWS resources and
their dependencies.
- Document interconnections and potential failure impacts using AWS CloudFormation
templates or other standard infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration files.

- Design individual component failure tests:

Automate failure simulations using AWS Lambda functions or AWS Fault Injection Service to test
hardware, software, and network issues.
- Define expected behavior and recovery procedures using Amazon CloudWatch alarms, and
AWS CloudFormation stacks.

- Develop complex failure scenarios:

Use auto scaling to model cascading failures, regional outages, and
multi-component disruptions.
- Test resilience by injecting faults across your AWS infrastructure using the
AWS Fault Injection Service.

- Establish success criteria:

Measure downtime, recovery time, and service quality metrics using Amazon CloudWatch
dashboards and alarms.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to set thresholds.

- Document and analyze results:

Define templates and formats for recording
test results, observations, and findings. Include detailed information about test
conditions, system behavior, and performance metrics.
- Review test results to identify common failure modes,
systemic issues, and potential vulnerabilities. Look for patterns that might
indicate underlying architectural or operational weaknesses.
- Document and analyze the time required for system
recovery under various failure scenarios. Compare results against service level
objectives and identify areas for improvement.
- Assess the effectiveness of automated recovery
mechanisms, failover procedures, and list down manual interventions. Identify gaps
in current procedures and opportunities for enhancement.
- Create a prioritized list of areas requiring
attention, including system improvements, process changes, and documentation
updates.
