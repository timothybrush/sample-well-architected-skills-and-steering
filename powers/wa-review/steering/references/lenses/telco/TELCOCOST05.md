# TELCOCOST05-BP01 Explore open interface-based technology like RAN or vRAN to reduce network-related costs

To examine O-RAN in more detail and understand the best practices for O-RAN architectures
on AWS, see [Open Radio Access Network Architecture on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/open-radio-access-network-architecture-on-aws/open-radio-access-network-architecture-on-aws.html).

**Desired outcome:**

- Achieve cost savings through the adoption of open interface-based RAN or vRAN
technologies.
- Increase flexibility and vendor independence in the radio access network.
- Improve scalability and agility in deploying new RAN capabilities.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Reliance on proprietary, vendor-locked RAN solutions that limit flexibility and
drive-up costs.
- Lack of consideration for open interface-based RAN architectures and their potential
benefits.
- Inability to rapidly adapt the RAN to changing business and technology requirements.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Significant cost savings through the adoption of open interface-based RAN/vRAN
technologies.
- Increased flexibility and vendor independence, reducing lock-in and enabling faster
innovation.
- Improved scalability and agility in deploying new RAN capabilities to meet evolving
demands.
- Enhanced ability to use cloud-based technologies and services to manage the RAN.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is an industry initiative that defines open interface
specifications for the radio access network (RAN). By adopting O-RAN and vRAN architectures,
telecoms can reduce network-related costs and increase flexibility in their RAN
infrastructure.

The O-RAN approach allows telecoms to decouple the different RAN components, such as the
Radio Unit (O-RU), Distributed Unit (O-DU), and Central Unit (O-CU), and use diverse
vendors and cloud-based technologies to build and manage their RAN. This reduces vendor
lock-in and enables faster innovation and adaptation to change requirements.

AWS provides various services and solutions, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Outposts, and AWS Wavelength,
that can support the deployment and management of O-RAN and vRAN components, making it easier for
telecoms to explore and adopt this open interface-based technology.

### Implementation steps

- Review the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture and understand its key
components, such as the O-RAN Radio Unit (O-RU), O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU), and
O-RAN Central Unit (O-CU).
- Assess the feasibility of adopting an O-RAN and vRAN architecture for your telco
network, considering factors like performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
- Evaluate AWS services and solutions that support the deployment and management of
O-RAN/vRAN components, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Outposts, and AWS Wavelength.
- Pilot an O-RAN and vRAN implementation in your network, focusing on a specific use case
or geographic region to validate the approach.
- Analyze the cost savings and other benefits achieved using open interface-based RAN
technologies.
- Based on the pilot results, develop a roadmap for the wider adoption of O-RAN and vRAN
across your telco network infrastructure.
