# TELCOOPS03-BP01 Implement an enterprise-grade IP Address Management solution with cloud infrastructure integration

Implement a cloud-based IPAM solution that is optimized for
performance and tightly integrated with the underlying cloud networking infrastructure. This
should provide reliable, scalable, and high-throughput IP address management capabilities
tailored for telco and high-performance networking workloads that require secondary network
interfaces.

**Desired outcome:**

- Reliable and scalable IP address management for secondary interfaces.
- Seamless integration with cloud infrastructure and container solutions.
- Enterprise-level support and maintenance.
- Automated IP allocation and de-allocation.
- Clear upgrade and patch management path.
- Consistent performance at scale.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Using unsupported or community-maintained IPAM solutions.
- Implementing manual IP address management processes.
- Missing integration with cloud infrastructure.
- Lack of monitoring and alerting for IP management.
- No consideration for support and maintenance.
- Poor documentation and operational procedures.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement an IP address management solution that meets enterprise requirements while
maintaining cloud-based integration capabilities. Focus on solutions that are officially
supported by both the solution vendor and container distribution provider. Verify the selected
solution provides comprehensive monitoring, automation capabilities, and clear escalation
paths for support. Consider future integration possibilities with native cloud services while
maintaining operational excellence today.

### Implementation steps

- Solution evaluation:

Document requirements for IP management including scale, performance, and
support needs.
- Evaluate enterprise-supported solutions from solution providers.
- Assess integration capabilities with AWS services.
- Verify support and maintenance agreements.
- Review upgrade and patch processes.

- Integration design:

Design integration architecture with AWS networking services.
- Plan monitoring and observability integration.
- Create automation workflows for IP management.
- Document operational procedures and support processes.

- Implementation and testing:

Deploy solution in test environment.
- Validate integration with AWS services.
- Perform scale and performance testing.
- Verify monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- Test upgrade and patch procedures.

- Operational readiness:

Create operational runbooks .
- Establish support procedures and escalation paths.
- Document backup and recovery processes.
- Implement change management procedures.

- Continuous improvement:

Regular review of solution performance.
- Monitor for new native cloud capabilities.
- Maintain upgrade and patch adherence.
- Regular testing of operational procedures.
