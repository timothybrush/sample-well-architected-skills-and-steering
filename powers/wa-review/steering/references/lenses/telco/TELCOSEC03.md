# TELCOSEC03-BP01 Secure the APIs used to expose telco network functionality

In modern telco networks, the Network Exposure Function (NEF) for 5G networks and the
Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) for 4G networks provide APIs to expose network
capabilities and services to external applications and partners. These APIs serve as the gateway
for accessing sensitive network resources and data, making it crucial to implement robust
security measures to protect them.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement strong authentication mechanisms and enforce role-based access control to
authorize API access based on client permissions and privileges. Manage user identities and
generate secure JSON web tokens. Verify API communication is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS
protocols and leverage web application firewalls to enforce and monitor security. Implement
API rate limiting and throttling to block potential denial-of-service attacks. Perform input
validation and sanitization on API requests and integrate comprehensive logging and monitoring
to detect and respond to suspicious API activity. Manage API versioning and deprecation to
verify clients use the latest secure versions and regularly assess API security through
automated testing and vulnerability management.

### Implementation steps

- API traffic encryption:

Verify API communication is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols with AWS Certificate Manager
to manage SSL/TLS certificates.
- Leverage AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to enforce SSL/TLS adherence and
monitor TLS cipher suite usage.

- API rate limiting and throttling:

Implement API rate limiting and throttling using Amazon API Gateway's built-in
throttling capabilities.
- Configure API Gateway to enforce rate limits and block potential denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks.

- API input validation and sanitization:

Utilize AWS Lambda functions as API backends to perform input validation and
sanitization using libraries like express-validator or Joi.
- Integrate Amazon API Gateway with AWS WAF to apply custom security rules for input
validation and protection against common web application vulnerabilities.

- API logging and monitoring:

Enable comprehensive logging of API requests and responses using Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms and Amazon SNS notifications to alert on suspicious API
activity.

- API versioning and deprecation:

USe Amazon API Gateway's versioning capabilities to manage multiple versions of the
NEF and SCEF APIs.
- Implement version-specific access controls using AWS IAM policies to verify
clients use the latest secure API versions.
- Utilize Amazon API Gateway's stage management features to deprecate older API versions
and provide clear migration guidelines.

- API security assessments:

Perform API security assessments using AWS Security Hub CSPM, which aggregates findings
from various AWS security services.
- Address identified vulnerabilities using AWS Systems Manager for patch management and
AWS Lambda for rapid remediation.
