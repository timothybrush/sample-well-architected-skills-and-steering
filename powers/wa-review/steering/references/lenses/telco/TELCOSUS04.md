# TELCOSUS04-BP01 Enhance telco network resilience to climate change risks

Climate resilience for telco networks requires architecting for extreme weather events,
implementing geographic redundancy, and establishing automated failover mechanisms. Design
your infrastructure to withstand increasing frequency of floods, heatwaves, storms, and other
climate-related disruptions while maintaining service continuity for critical communications.

**Desired outcome:** Achieve network availability despite
climate-related disruptions through geographic redundancy, automated failover mechanisms, and
predictive risk management, maintaining continuous service for critical communications during
extreme weather events.

**Benefits of establishing this practice:**

- Maintained network availability during
extreme weather events.
- Achieve reduction in climate-related
service disruptions.
- Enhanced capacity to support
disaster response communications.
- Meeting government requirements for
critical infrastructure resilience.
- Improved reputation as reliable service
provider during emergencies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established**:
Low

## Implementation guidance

Start by mapping your network infrastructure against climate risk data to identify
vulnerable locations. For high-risk areas, implement additional redundancy and strengthened
physical protection. Deploy critical network functions across multiple AWS Regions and
Availability Zones to verify geographic diversity. For edge locations, use AWS Outposts with
ruggedized options for harsh environments.

Implement real-time environmental monitoring at cell sites and data centers to detect
climate-related threats early. Use predictive analytics to anticipate weather-related traffic
surges (emergency calls during disasters) and pre-scale resources accordingly. Design
automated response systems that can reroute traffic, activate backup sites, and notify
operations teams without manual intervention.

### Implementation steps

Deploy AWS Outposts or Local Zones in geographically diverse locations, maintaining
critical network functions are distant apart to avoid single weather event impact.

- Implement AWS Backup with cross-Region replication for critical telco workloads,
with the appropriate Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) for essential services.
- Configure Amazon Route 53 health checks with automatic DNS failover for critical
endpoints, verifying traffic reroutes upon failure detection.
- Set up AWS IoT Core to collect environmental data (like temperature, humidity, and water
levels) from cell sites, with IoT Analytics to predict climate-related risks.
- Create AWS Lambda functions triggered by weather API data to automatically scale
resources in anticipation of emergency traffic surges.
- Implement AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex disaster recovery workflows, including
service failover, data synchronization, and stakeholder notifications.
- Deploy Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continuously monitor service availability from
multiple geographic locations, simulating user traffic patterns.
- Configure AWS Systems Manager Automation documents for common climate-related scenarios
(like power outage response, flooding protocols, and heatwave procedures).
