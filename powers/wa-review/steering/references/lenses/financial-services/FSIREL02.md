# FSIREL02: Are you practicing continuous resilience to ensure that your services meet regulatory availability and recovery requirements?

Your workload, and the environment in which it operates, is
constantly changing. To keep pace, resiliency practices should
not be considered a one-time effort. Make resilience a regular
part of your feature delivery and operational cadence
throughout a workload's lifetime. To this end, resiliency
testing should be part of your CI/CD testing pipelines.

Furthermore, you should establish a resiliency review on a
regular interval to validate that changes have not impacted
the application's resiliency posture. In addition to this, the
rise of generative AI have added a recommended pattern to
allow
[cross-region
inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html) or
[provisioned
throughput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html) to facilitate more reliable calls to
generative AI models.

## FSIREL02-BP01 Practice regular resilience testing

Resilience is not a one-time effort. Resilience should be
part of your day-to-day operations and practiced
continuously. Perform chaos engineering experiments and
scenario testing like
[Fault
Injection Service](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) or Cross-Region connectivity faults
regularly to increase your team's understanding of how your
workload behaves in adverse conditions such as excessive
load, slow or failed network links, or a combination of
adverse conditions. Continuous testing for resilience helps
you to anticipate, observe, and respond to faults, as well
as find blind spots that you didn't know existed. By
practicing continuous resilience testing and
[chaos
engineering](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/chaos-testing-with-aws-fault-injection-simulator-and-aws-codepipeline/), your teams can improve observability and
gain confidence in their ability to quickly detect and
recover from incidents as recovery procedures are practiced
and improved.

## FSIREL02-BP02 Implement an operational readiness review process

To capture learnings from previous incidents and minimize reoccurrence across
teams, implement an [operational readiness review
process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/wa-operational-readiness-reviews.html) within your organization. As part of your incident
analysis process, identify key questions that, if asked prior to the incident, may
have prevented the incident from occurring. Maintain a list of these key questions so
that, as new features are released, your developers can refer back to the list and
make sure that they don't repeat the same mistakes that have disrupted other
workloads.
