# FSISUS05: How do you define, review, and optimize network access patterns for sustainability?

Assess and optimize network access patterns for sustainability. Pay attention to
redundant layers and redirects or patterns generating excessive and unnecessary data
movement.

## FSISUS05-BP01 Analyze network access patterns to identify the places that your customers are connecting from

**Prescriptive guidance**

Remove redundant layers and redirects, use pagination and local caching mechanisms to
reduce data movement, and consider separating workloads that serve different users.

## FSISUS05-BP02 Avoid common architectural misconfigurations

In financial services organizations, it's common to hairpin large amounts of traffic
through on- premises networks, have largely redundant layers of control using trusted
private networks, and sometimes include untrusted public traffic.

A simple example of this is using [AWS Direct Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) where performance is often degraded as FSI organizations insist
that all inbound and outbound traffic originates from their network.

Another common mistake is to serve both OLAP and OLTP workloads from the same
database or cluster, which normally span two or more completely different geographic
locations. Both patterns generate excessive and unnecessary data movement.

### Prescriptive guidance

Identify poor architectural choices and risky configurations as good candidates for
remediation.

Assess your workflows from the perspective of varying demand over time, so select
scalable AWS services over fixed ones.

Do not underestimate your network requirements, especially for peak loads. Provide
sufficient failover resources to support your operations in case of partial outages.

Optimize generative AI inference patterns to minimize data transfer and network
overhead.

Implement edge inference for generative AI models where appropriate to reduce
network traffic.

Use efficient prompt engineering to reduce token lengths and network utilization.
