# FSICOST09: Are you using the cost advantages of tiered storage?

FSI companies usually have long retention policies for their regulatory and audit
requirements. They usually span multiple years and might even be able to take up to a day or
two to be able to retrieve old data. Understand and use the cost advantages of tiered
storage.

## FSICOST09-BP01 Define data retention policies to select the right storage type for your data lifecycle

FSI companies usually have long retention policies for their regulatory and audit
requirements. They usually span multiple years and might even be able to take up to a day
or two to be able to retrieve old data. Defining data retention policies and corresponding
architecture to transfer data from main storage to archival storage is important. This can
be achieved by transferring data from RDS database to S3 or creating a snapshot and
storing it for better cost efficiencies.

Apply lifecycle policies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) artifacts and
generative AI datasets: maintain hot vector indexes (for current-quarter documents or
active knowledge bases) in high-performance vector databases, transition warm data
(historical embeddings or older training data) to object storage such as Amazon S3 Standard–IA,
and archive cold or infrequently accessed corpora (for example, legacy PDFs, or processed
embeddings) in Amazon Glacier or Deep Archive. Automate transitions using S3 Lifecycle policies to
minimize long-term storage costs while preserving retrieval fidelity when needed.
