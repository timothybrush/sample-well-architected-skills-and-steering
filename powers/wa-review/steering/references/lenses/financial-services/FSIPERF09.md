# FSIPERF09: How do you monitor and tune AI system performance?

Financial services AI systems require sophisticated monitoring
and tuning approaches to maintain optimal performance while
meeting regulatory requirements and business objectives.

## FSIPERF09-BP01 Implement comprehensive AI performance monitoring

Establish monitoring frameworks that capture the full
spectrum of AI system performance metrics relevant to
financial services operations.

### Key monitoring dimensions:

- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and domain-specific
metrics for financial predictions.
- GPU utilization, memory consumption, CPU usage, and network
latency for AI workloads.
- Revenue impact of AI decisions, regulatory compliance
scores, and customer satisfaction metrics.
- Model drift detection, data quality scores, and prediction
confidence levels.

### Implementation steps:

- Deploy Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights for monitoring
containerized AI workloads.
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing of AI inference
pipelines through financial systems.
- Configure Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor for automated
detection of model drift and data quality issues.
- Implement custom CloudWatch metrics for business-specific
KPIs related to AI performance.

## FSIPERF09-BP02 Establish automated performance tuning for AI workloads

Implement automated tuning mechanisms that can adapt AI system
performance to changing workload patterns and performance
requirements in financial services environments.

### Automated tuning approaches:

- Configure dynamic scaling based on inference volume, latency
targets, and cost constraints.
- Use Amazon SageMaker AI Automatic Model Tuning for continuous
model improvement.
- Implement automated instance type selection based on
workload characteristics and performance requirements.
- Use intelligent routing to distribute AI workloads across
optimal inference endpoints.

### Implementation steps:

- Implement A/B testing frameworks. Continuously test model
improvements against production baselines.
- Perform a canary analysis. Gradually roll out performance
improvements with automated rollback capabilities
- Use multi-armed bandit algorithms. Optimize model selection
and routing for maximum business value.
- Use feedback loops. Incorporate real-time performance data
into model retraining and optimization pipelines.

## FSIPERF09-BP03 Monitor AI model accuracy and business impact

Establishing monitoring systems that track both technical
performance and business outcomes enables financial
institutions to proactively identify model degradation,
regulatory risks, and revenue impact, reducing operational
losses, preventing costly regulatory penalties, and verifying
that AI systems continue delivering measurable ROI while
maintaining the trust and transparency required for
customer-facing financial decisions.

### Implementation steps:

- Compare model predictions against known outcomes for
accuracy assessment.
- Monitor prediction confidence levels and flag
low-confidence decisions for human review.
- Implement statistical tests to detect changes in input
data distribution that may affect model performance.
- Track model decisions for bias, fairness, and regulatory
compliance requirements.

### Business impact tracking:

- Monitor revenue impact, cost savings, and risk reduction
attributed to AI decisions.
- Track processing time reductions and automation rates
achieved through AI implementation.
- Measure customer satisfaction and engagement improvements
from AI-powered services.
- Monitor false positive and negative rates for fraud
detection and credit risk models.
