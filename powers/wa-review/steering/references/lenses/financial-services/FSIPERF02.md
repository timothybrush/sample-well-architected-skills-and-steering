# FSIPERF02: How do you select your compute architecture?

## FSIPERF02-BP01 Select your compute architecture based on workload requirements

The optimal compute solution for a particular architecture depends on the workload
deployment method, degree of automation, usage patterns, and configuration. Third-party
solutions can bring their own requirements for infrastructure, which must also be
considered. Different compute solutions may be chosen for each step of a process.
Selecting the wrong compute solutions for an architecture can lead to lower performance
efficiency.

Some financial services computing workloads, like risk modeling, are typically
loosely coupled and can benefit from event-driven architectures leveraging the scaling
capacity of AWS serverless compute options like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate, combined
with messaging services including Amazon SQS and Amazon EventBridge to decouple components. These
serverless solutions minimize the overhead of capacity management, automatically scaling
in or out to meet demands.

Containerized infrastructure can enable financial services institutions to achieve
their goals for speed and scalability by providing a standardized environment to leverage
across multiple solutions, and supporting the development of microservice-based
architectures. Where scale is the primary factor, AWS serverless container compute
engine, AWS Fargate, can be used with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS),
removing the overhead of managing and provisioning compute resources.

For solutions with more specific performance requirements, or needing to run on
virtual machines as their compute solution, AWS offers a wide range of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instance types, which you can use to select the configuration that is best suited to your
needs at any given time. This allows you to both take advantage of the latest CPU
technologies as they are released without consideration for prior investment, and choose
instance types with features that best suit your workload's requirements, for example
instance variants optimized for network, storage, or compute performance.

The [Financial Services Grid Computing on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/financial-services-grid-computing/grid-computing-on-aws.html) whitepaper explores this topic in
more detail for specific workloads.

## FSIPERF02-BP02 Select appropriate GPU and accelerated computing for AI workloads

Financial services AI workloads require careful selection of
compute infrastructure to balance performance, cost, and
regulatory requirements. Different AI use cases within
financial services have varying compute requirements that
should guide infrastructure selection.

**GPU instance selection:**

- P4d instances for large-scale model training and fine-tuning
of foundation models on financial datasets
- P5 instances for the most demanding AI training workloads
requiring maximum GPU performance
- G5 instances for real-time AI inference workloads like fraud
detection and trading algorithm
- G4dn instances for cost-effective AI inference at scale for
applications like document processing and customer service
chatbots
- Inf2 instances powered by AWS Inferentia2 chips for
high-throughput, low-cost inference of transformer models

**Implementation
considerations:**

- Use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for non-critical AI training
workloads to reduce costs.
- Use Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for distributed AI training
across multiple instances.
- Consider AWS Batch for managing AI training jobs that can
run on mixed instance types.
- Use Amazon SageMaker AI managed infrastructure for production
AI workloads with built-in optimization.

**Accelerated computing for specific
financial AI workloads:**

- Use G5 instances with GPU memory optimized for low-latency
inference.
- Use parallel computing capabilities of P4d instances for
risk modeling and Monte Carlo simulations.
- For document processing and regulatory compliance, use Inf2
instances for transformer-based document analysis.
- Consider F1 instances with FPGAs for ultra-low latency
requirements and algorithmic trading.
