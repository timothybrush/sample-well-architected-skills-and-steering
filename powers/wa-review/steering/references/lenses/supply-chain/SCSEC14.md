# SCSEC14-BP01 Implement comprehensive code and dependency integrity validation

Maintaining the integrity of application code and dependencies is
critical for helping to prevent supply chain attacks that target
software components. Organizations should implement code signing
to verify authenticity and help prevent tampering with application
components. Automated scanning of dependencies for known
vulnerabilities should be integrated into development workflows to
identify security issues before deployment. Establishing trusted
repositories for approved components and implementing integrity
verification during build and deployment processes creates
multiple layers of protection against compromised software in the
supply chain.

**Desired outcome:** Verified and
secure code and dependencies throughout the supply chain
application lifecycle.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Reduced risk of compromised applications and
improved overall security of the supply chain environment.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Use code signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of
code, involving digitally signing the code with a cryptographic
key to validate it has not been tampered with. Use tools like
AWS CodeArtifact to manage and securely store dependencies,
making sure only approved and verified dependencies are used in
applications, while regularly scanning dependencies for known
vulnerabilities using automated security scanning tools.

### Implementation steps

- Implement code signing processes to digitally sign all
application code and components, supporting authenticity
and helping to prevent tampering throughout the
development and deployment lifecycle.
- Establish secure dependency management using trusted
repositories and automated scanning tools to identify and
remediate vulnerabilities in third-party components before
deployment.
- Implement strict access controls and audit logs in source
control systems to track changes and make sure only
authorized personnel can modify code and dependencies.
- Integrate automated security checks into CI/CD pipelines
to validate code and dependency integrity during build and
deployment processes, helping to prevent compromised
components from reaching production.
- Deploy runtime protection measures and monitoring tools to
detect and respond to unauthorized changes or suspicious
activities in real-time during application execution.
- Establish comprehensive monitoring and logging systems to
maintain visibility into code and dependency integrity
across the entire application lifecycle and supply chain
environment.
