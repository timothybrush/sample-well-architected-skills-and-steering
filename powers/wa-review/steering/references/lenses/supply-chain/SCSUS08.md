# SCSUS08-BP01 Collect usage data to feed advanced analysis and ML models to better predict future resources needs

Consider improving your ability to predict AWS Cloud resources
required for your supply chain and sustainability-related
workloads to prefer on-demand over always-on. Base this data on
forecasts, seasonality, and peaks and valleys analysis to
efficiently turn resources on and off accordingly or scaling
resources up and down and horizontally.

**Desired outcome**: Achieve
dynamic scalability and resource efficiency by using historical
usage data to predict and optimize resource needs.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Improves operational agility, reduces
downtime, and minimizes unnecessary resource usage.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Consider collecting data about resource usage over the past
years to design and prefer on-demand over always-on, with the
main goal of optimizing resources scaling, uptime and downtime,
availability, and replication based on your business needs.

Gain visibility of required resources through ML-based
predictions, using built-in features of AWS System Manager,
Instance Scheduler on AWS, and signals from Amazon CloudWatch,
while using managed databases like Amazon RDS, and
[containers
orchestration](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/) running on AWS towards serverless
architectures.

### Implementation steps

- Collect and analyze historical resource usage data to
identify patterns and optimization opportunities for
on-demand resource allocation.
- Implement machine learning-based prediction models to
forecast future resource needs based on business patterns
and seasonality.
- Deploy AWS Systems Manager and Instance Scheduler to
automate resource scheduling based on predicted demand
patterns.
- Configure Amazon CloudWatch monitoring to provide
real-time signals for dynamic resource scaling decisions.
- Migrate appropriate workloads to managed databases and
serverless architectures to optimize resource utilization.
- Establish continuous monitoring and optimization processes
to refine on-demand resource strategies over time.
