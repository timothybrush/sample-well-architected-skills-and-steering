# SCSEC08-BP01 Implement strong key management in your supply chain systems

Effective encryption key management is fundamental to protecting
sensitive data across supply chain operations. This includes
implementing secure processes for key generation, storage,
rotation, and revocation throughout the key lifecycle.
Organizations should establish clear separation of duties for key
management activities and make sure keys are protected with strong
access controls. Regular auditing of key usage and implementing
automated rotation schedules helps maintain the integrity of
encryption throughout the supply chain environment.

**Desired outcome:** Secure and
controlled management of encryption keys throughout the supply
chain systems, supporting data protection and compliance.

**Benefits**
**of establishing this best
practice:** Enhanced data security, reduced risk of
unauthorized access, and improved compliance through centralized
key management.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Manage encryption keys across different supply chain stages,
creating separate keys for distinct operations (supplier data,
logistics documents, customs documentation) with rotation
policies aligned to compliance requirements. Implement key
policies and access controls that reflect supply chain partner
relationships, using temporary access grants during specific
supply chain events like customs inspections or quality audits.

### Implementation steps

- Manage encryption keys across different supply chain
stages, creating separate keys for distinct operations
(supplier data, logistics documents, customs
documentation) with rotation policies aligned to
compliance requirements.
- Implement key policies and access controls that reflect
supply chain partner relationships, using temporary access
grants during specific supply chain events like customs
inspections or quality audits.
- Enable comprehensive key usage monitoring focused on
supply chain-critical operations, tracking encryption
activities across trade documentation, cross-border data
transfers, and partner data exchanges.
- Configure automated alerts for unusual encryption key
usage patterns that might indicate supply chain process
violations or security incidents.
- Establish a centralized encryption governance framework
that documents key ownership, usage purposes, and access
patterns across the entire supply chain environment.
- Create regular key inventory and access review processes
to make sure encryption controls remain aligned with
evolving supply chain relationships and compliance
requirements.
