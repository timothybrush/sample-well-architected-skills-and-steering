# EUCOPS08-BP01 Adopt a mandatory and formalized process for managing any changes to EUC services and dependent infrastructure

Create a new process or integrate with existing processes that track all changes that
can affect the stability and security of your EUC deployment.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Track all changes which might directly or indirectly affect the performance and
availability of Amazon WorkSpaces or Amazon WorkSpaces Applications services. Implement a change control
process that documents each service update with a robust risk assessment and back-out plan
and involves technology stakeholders from all relevant areas. This process can reduce the
risk of service outages or degradation.

Both WorkSpaces and Amazon WorkSpaces Applications have key dependencies on many external services.
If changes to any of these services is required, a representative from the AWS EUC team
should be part of the change control team to review and quantify the risk of the change.

The service dependencies for Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon WorkSpaces Applications include, but are not
restricted to:

- AWS networking
- Active Directory and connectors
- RADIUS
- Microsoft PKI (if certificate-based authentication is in use)
- Third Party PKI services that may be used to allocate public certificates for
related services
- AWS KMS if used for encryption of WorkSpaces images
- SAML 2.0 IdP availability (if SAML 2.0 authentication is in use)
- Private certificate authority (if certificate-based authentication is in use)
- User data repositories (like file shares or profile stores)
- Application web tiers
- Application database tiers
- Application licensing servers
- Web proxies
- Firewalls and other related security infrastructure
- Anti-malware infrastructure
- Thin client management infrastructure

Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon WorkSpaces Applications also use other AWS services, such as Amazon EBS and
Amazon S3 for storage, so you should understand any changes being made to these systems.
