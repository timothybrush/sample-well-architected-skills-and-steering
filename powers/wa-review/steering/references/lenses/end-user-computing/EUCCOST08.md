# EUCCOST08-BP01 Monitor your Amazon WorkSpaces usage, and implement the Cost Optimizer for Amazon WorkSpaces

The Cost Optimizer for Amazon WorkSpaces generates reports you
can use to understand the usage of individual WorkSpaces. Based
on these reports, identify underutilized WorkSpaces or
WorkSpaces that are no longer in use so that you can assess
whether to terminate them.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Deploy the Cost Optimizer for Amazon WorkSpaces, and perform
regular reviews of your WorkSpaces usage reported by the Cost
Optimizer for Amazon WorkSpaces. Based on your findings,
decide which WorkSpaces to terminate, and initiate a
conversation with owners of underutilized WorkSpaces to
understand if these are still needed. Agree on how, when, and
by whom any changes are to be applied.

# EUCCOST08-BP02 Monitor your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications fleet utilization, and optimize scaling policies and buffer capacity

Use [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/?nc1=h_ls) to observe and
monitor your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications resources. Amazon WorkSpaces Applications publishes several [WorkSpaces Applications
Metrics and Dimensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html) to Amazon CloudWatch that you can visualize and use to check if you
are overprovisioning buffer capacity or if you are running into capacity shortages at times.
Use these metrics to adjust your WorkSpaces Applications Fleet capacity and scaling policies to minimize idle
capacity and reduce insufficient capacity errors where possible.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Create your own customized CloudWatch dashboards to visualize key WorkSpaces Applications metrics for your
WorkSpaces Applications fleets. These dashboards can contain several widgets that display a view of
selected metrics of a specific WorkSpaces Applications fleet or across multiple WorkSpaces Applications fleets. Review these
dashboards on a regular basis.

Additionally, use the EUC Toolkit to review Amazon CloudWatch and OS-level metrics. This
Toolkit also helps you manage large WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications deployments at scale. After review of
the metrics, determine whether changes to the fleet capacity or scaling policies are
required, and plan for how to implement those changes. For more information, see [Use the EUC
Toolkit to manage Amazon WorkSpaces Applications and Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/euc-toolkit/)
