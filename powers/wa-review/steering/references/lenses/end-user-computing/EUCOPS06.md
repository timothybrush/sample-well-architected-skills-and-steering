# EUCOPS06-BP01 Deploy test, development, and pre-production environments to reduce risk to production services

Training and testing should be undertaken in isolated environments, with little or no
connectivity to production services.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Separate the EUC environments used for training, testing, and development from
production services to reduce the risk of non-production activities affecting normal
business operations. Create discrete test environments and use them for activities that
could disrupt production services, cause outages or performance degradation, or compromise
security.

When testing and staging new releases or updates to production systems, these should
be undertaken in a separate environment that matches the current production deployment as
closely as possible. This reduces the likelihood of issues arising from disparities
between test, staging and production.

AWS EUC services are Regional in nature and delivered on an AWS account by
account basis. Multiple Regions and accounts can be deployed to separate training,
testing, and production environments.

Multiple AWS accounts can also be deployed to separate production workloads for
scalability reasons, helping to avoid having all resources in the same place or where
service separation is necessary to align with compliance or security requirements.

AWS Control Tower can be used to streamline the management and governance of multiple
AWS accounts.

Unlike on-premises infrastructure, Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications environments can be
[deployed using automated processes](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/2020_0210-EUC_Slide-Deck.pdf) and only attract costs while in use.

AWS CloudFormation templates can be used to deploy new AWS services such as WorkSpaces and
WorkSpaces Applications to reduce the likelihood of human error and reduce configuration drift.

AWS Systems Manager Runbooks can be used to automate some aspects of WorkSpaces deployment. For
more detail, see [SSM
Runbooks for Amazon WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-ref-wsp.html).
