# EUCSEC12-BP01 Allow user access to only the software binaries needed to perform their job

Users should only have access to the software binaries required
for them to perform their role. Access to additional software
that could introduce risks should be blocked.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Implement security controls to restrict access to software
binaries. Permissions applied to software binaries present on
Amazon WorkSpaces or WorkSpaces Applications instances should restrict
the ability for users to run the programs and applications
that they require to fulfill their role. Evaluate other
software binaries present in the image to verify that the
default permissions applied in the file system do not permit
users to run them.

System hardening should also be considered to further secure
the operating system image. For reference, consider the Center
for Internet Security (CIS) AWS End User Compute Services
Benchmark. You can apply your chosen security settings by
incorporating them into the image pre-deployment,
post-deployment using scripts, or for Windows instances by
using Group Policy Objects (GPOs). In addition, for Windows
instances, consider FSLogix or AppLocker to restrict access to
specific software binaries.
