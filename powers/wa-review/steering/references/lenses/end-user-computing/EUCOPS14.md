# EUCOPS14-BP01 Ingest log file data from multiple data sources to correlate key problem identifiers and trends

Identify and implement mechanisms to maintain a centralized source of EUC service data
that can be used for root cause analysis of cross service issues.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Store logs and metrics from AWS EUC services and their dependent services in a
centralized location to allow analysis tools to build a picture of cross system failures
that are affecting AWS EUC reliability. For example, expiry of a critical SSL
certificate on a load balancer or remote access tier may be the root cause of login
degradation or other failures at the AWS EUC service tier.

Use Amazon CloudWatch to gather metrics and logs, which are stored for subsequent analysis, to
identify problems or trends that have occurred over time.

Amazon Kinesis agents can be installed onto Amazon WorkSpaces or WorkSpaces Applications images to export log
file data in real time to a centralized location for retrospective analysis.

For larger environments, consider creating a data lake of key data from system logs,
performance monitoring, and security tools across all service lines. Develop analysis
capabilities using Amazon AI/ML tools to generate a more holistic insight into end to end
systems health and scalability.

Note
Review CloudWatch and Kinesis data retention policies and service charges to verify that
data availability and costs are within EUC project guidelines.
