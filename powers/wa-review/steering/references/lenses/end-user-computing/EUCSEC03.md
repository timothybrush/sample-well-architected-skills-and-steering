# EUCSEC03-BP01 Restrict user permissions to the minimum required to perform their role

To implement the principle of least privilege when configuring
AWS EUC services, define appropriate access controls for role
categories like users, service desk users, first-level
administrators, second-level administrators, and accounts used
for automation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

- **Limit the use of administrator
permissions:** Users should not be granted local
administrator access to Amazon WorkSpaces or WorkSpaces Applications
instances unless it is required for them to undertake
their role. Use tools and products that provide the
ability to temporarily provide elevated rights in
preference to granting users long term administrative
access.
- **Do not provide all support staff
with administrator permissions:** Grant service
desk users should the minimal set of access permissions to
allow them to perform their function. This can vary among
organizations, but service desk users should not be
granted full access to the Amazon WorkSpaces and AppStream
2.0 services.
- **Use administrative toolsets and
automation to avoid the need to provide administrator
permissions:** Administrators providing
first-level support for the users consuming the AWS EUC
service can use the enhanced administrative toolset that
AWS offers in the form of the EUC toolkit. For more detail
on the EUC Toolkit, see
[Use EUC Toolkit to manage Amazon WorkSpaces Applications and Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/euc-toolkit/).
- **Audit and monitor privileged or
sensitive operations:** Log any privileged or
sensitive operations associated with the management of AWS
EUC services. These logs can then be used to generate
alerts as required.
- **Use temporary elevated access for
privileged or sensitive operations:** When users
occasionally require elevated or privileged access to
support or operate the environment, provide a way for them
to gain temporary elevated access. For an example of
temporary elevated access to AWS IAM Identity Center, see
[Temporary
elevated access for AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/temporary-elevated-access.html).
- **Restrict the allocation and use of
IAM permissions providing service access:**
Administrators providing second or third-level support
that use the AWS Management console require IAM
permissions. Grant the minimal set of permissions to
administrative users providing an enhanced level of
support to users using
[Amazon WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/workspaces-access-control.html) and

[AppStream
2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/controlling-administrator-access-with-policies-roles.html) for them to fulfill their role.
- **Restrict the scope of access for
service accounts:** Restrict permissions for
service accounts for Amazon WorkSpaces (with Active
Directory Connector) and Amazon WorkSpaces Applications (with
domain-joined fleets) to only allow them to create
computer objects within their designated Organizational
Unit (OU). For implementing service accounts, see
[Amazon
WorkSpaces Applications Active Directory Administration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/active-directory-admin.html#active-directory-permissions) and

[AD
Connector prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/prereq_connector.html#connect_delegate_privileges).
