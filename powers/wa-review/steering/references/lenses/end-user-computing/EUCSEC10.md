# EUCSEC10-BP01 Implement network separation for AWS EUC instances

Separating end user systems from infrastructure, application
servers, and data at the network level verifies that you can
enforce minimal access between systems to help prevent
unauthorized access to data and applications.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Enforce network separation between user instances and other
services. EUC instances provided by Amazon WorkSpaces or
WorkSpaces Applications usually have network connectivity to other
workloads in the same network subnet. The use of security
groups within VPCs can restrict lateral movement and are
recommended for implementation. For defense-in-depth, non-end
user instances such as application servers, authentication
providers, and other infrastructure services should reside on
subnets different to those where user instances reside.

You can apply security controls to the non-end user instances
at various points using AWS capabilities, such as separate AWS accounts and VPCs, VPC endpoints, proxy servers, and network
firewalls. Review network security best practices for
[WorkSpaces](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/best-practices-vpcs-networking-amazon-workspaces-deployments.pdf)
and

[AppStream
2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/what-is-appstream.html) to improve security posture in your EUC
environment.

# EUCSEC10-BP02 Restrict access to open ports on instances to reduce risks

Restrict use of network ports on end user systems to reduce the
potential exposure surface of these systems. Block network ports
that aren't required for the operation and support of end user
systems using host-based or network firewalls.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Implement networking security controls on Amazon EUC
instances. AWS provides several services and capabilities that
can help you secure AWS EUC instances for Amazon WorkSpaces
and WorkSpaces Applications. In addition to these services, consider OS
capabilities and additional software to provide the required
level of security.

For AWS networking, the following services and features should
be evaluated:

- Network ACLs
- Security groups
- AWS Network Firewall
- NAT Gateway

Consider these services to create a baseline of network
security. Additionally, review and explore
[best
practices for VPC and networking in WorkSpaces](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/best-practices-vpcs-networking-amazon-workspaces-deployments.pdf), as well
as
[best practices for deploying WorkSpaces Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/best-practices-for-deploying-amazon-appstream-2/best-practices-for-deploying-amazon-appstream-2.html), as you evaluate
your network security.

In addition to AWS security capabilities and services, when
users require access to the Internet from browsers installed
in Amazon WorkSpaces or WorkSpaces Applications instances, consider
using a web proxy to log web site access and implement
restrictions on where users can browse.

In Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications instances, consider
existing OS software to harden the instances. For example, you
can use host-based firewalls available within the operating
system to restrict accessible ports in your instances. In
addition, consider endpoint protection software to identify
and mitigate security risks that may be introduced into the
environment using software local to the instances. For detail
on the ports required by Amazon WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces Applications,
see the following:
