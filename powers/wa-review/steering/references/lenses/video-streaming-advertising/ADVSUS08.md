# ADVSUS08-BP01 Optimize privacy workload processing patterns and resource allocation for sustainability

For privacy-enhanced collaboration, advertising workloads have specific sustainability considerations for combining first and third-party customer data directly.

## Implementation guidance

- Schedule intensive privacy computations during periods of
lower carbon intensity.
- Use batch processing for data cleansing and matching
operations.
- Implement efficient data compression and formatting using
formats such as Parquet.
- Leverage AWS Graviton processors for energy-efficient
computing.
- Use serverless architectures for matching operations where
possible.
- Implement auto scaling based on actual collaboration
workload patterns.
- Configure Regional data aggregation before central
processing to reduce transfer needs.
