# ADVREL08-BP01 Design resilient architectures with privacy-preserving fault tolerance

Build resilient architectures that maintain data privacy in multi-party collaborations, focusing on fault-tolerant AWS Clean Rooms deployment, encrypted failover mechanisms, and privacy-preserving disaster recovery procedures.

## Implementation guidance

- Deploy AWS Clean Rooms across multiple Regions with
replicated privacy policies, differential privacy budgets,
and encrypted collaboration configurations to facilitate
continuous privacy-protected analytics during regional
outages.
- Configure automatic failover for AWS Clean Rooms and Nitro
Enclaves with cross-Region KMS key access, synchronized
IAM roles, and validated privacy control restoration to
maintain cryptographic isolation and data protection
during service transitions.
- Implement privacy-aware error handling for data matching
with encrypted retry queues, failed operation logging that
preserves anonymity, and automatic termination of
computations that cannot maintain privacy guarantees
during processing errors.
- Deploy circuit breakers with privacy validation that
fail-closed when privacy controls cannot be verified,
monitor differential privacy budget exhaustion, and halt
operations when cryptographic attestation fails in
dependent services.
- Monitor AWS Clean Rooms privacy metrics including query
result threshold compliance, privacy budget consumption
rates, unauthorized access attempts, and cryptographic
operation health with automated alerts for privacy policy
violations.
- Use encrypted dead-letter queues for failed matching
operations with privacy context preservation, secure
purging policies for expired operations, and manual review
processes that maintain data anonymization during failure
analysis.
- Automate backup of privacy-protected datasets with
cross-Region encrypted replication, privacy policy version
control, differential privacy state preservation, and
recovery procedures that validate privacy controls before
data restoration.

# ADVREL08-BP02 Maintain data consistency and availability across collaboration workflows

Data consistency and availability is critical when working with multiple stakeholders or workflows. Implement tools like versioning, logging, and health checks to verify that data remains consistent and available.

## Implementation guidance

- Implement versioning for collaborative datasets and
schemas.
- Use transaction logs for tracking privacy computation
state.
- Configure cross-Region replication for critical data
stores.
- Implement idempotency for matching operations.
- Set up health checks for collaboration service endpoints.
- Use read replicas for high-availability data access.
- Configure automated rollback procedures for failed
operations.

# ADVREL08-BP03 Implement secure and privacy-preserving recovery mechanisms for collaboration workloads

Ad data requires security and preservation of privacy. Implement tooling and systems that preserve secure data and avoid privacy breaches when collaborating with first and third parties, and verify that you have disaster recovery and automated backup mechanisms in place.

## Implementation guidance

- Design recovery procedures that maintain data encryption
throughout the process.
- Implement point-in-time recovery for privacy-protected
datasets.
- Configure automated backup verification with privacy
controls intact.
- Set up secure backup encryption key rotation policies.
- Establish recovery time objectives (RTOs) aligned with
privacy requirements. This is because privacy requirements
can significantly extend RTOs by adding mandatory
verification and security steps.
- Implement secure state management for interrupted privacy
computations. For example, if encryption fails during
recovery, then halt the process rather than expose data;
if privacy controls can't be verified then deny access
until controls are restored; If secure state can't be
maintained then terminate the computation safely
- Create automated disaster recovery testing procedures.
