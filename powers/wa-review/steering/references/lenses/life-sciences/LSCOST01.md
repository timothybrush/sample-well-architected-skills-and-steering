# LSCOST01-BP01 Establish and implement a comprehensive financial governance framework

A financial governance framework in life sciences cloud management
establishes the structure, policies, and processes for making
financial decisions related to cloud usage. It verifies that cloud
spending aligns with research priorities, regulatory requirements,
and overall business objectives.

**Desired outcome:** A mature,
organization-wide financial governance environment that provides
complete visibility and control over cloud spending across each life
sciences research initiative, enabling predictable budget
management, automated cost optimization, and strategic alignment
between cloud investments and research outcomes while adhering to
regulatory and organizational financial policies.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Build a
[Cloud
Center of Excellence (CCoE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-center-of-excellence/introduction.html) with representatives from
research, IT, finance, and security.

Develop a cloud cost allocation model that ties expenses to
specific research projects or therapeutic areas.

Implement tagging policies and service control policies (SCPs) to
enforce tagging strategies across your organization.

Establish approval workflows for high-cost cloud resources with
different thresholds for various research stages. For
example, consider using
[AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) for cost management and
[Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) for deployment of pre-approved services.

### Implementation steps

- Form the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE):

Identify key stakeholders from your organization's
departments.
- Define roles and responsibilities for each CCoE member.
- Schedule regular CCoE meetings to oversee the framework
implementation.

- Develop the cloud cost allocation model:

Map out existing research projects and therapeutic
areas.
- Create a cost structure that links cloud expenses to
specific initiatives.
- Design a reporting system to track and allocate costs
accurately.

- Implement tagging policies:

Define a comprehensive tagging strategy for cloud
resources.
- Create service control policies (SCPs) to enforce the
tagging rules.
- Configure automated tagging where possible to improve
consistency.

- Establish approval workflows:

Define thresholds for high-cost cloud resources at
different research stages
- Set up AWS Budgets for cost management:

Create budget alerts for various spending
thresholds.
- Configure notifications for key stakeholders when
budgets are approaching limits.

- Implement Service Catalog:

Create a portfolio of pre-approved services and
resources.
- Set up governance and access controls for the
Service Catalog.

- Continuous improvement:

Stay informed about new cloud services and cost
optimization strategies.
- Regularly update the framework to incorporate best
practices and new technologies.

# LSCOST01-BP02 Analyze and optimize vendor cost structures and economic relationships

Vendor economics focuses on optimizing the costs associated with
various cloud vendors, software providers, and third-party services
used in life sciences research. It aims to maximize value while
maintaining the necessary tools and services for effective research.

**Desired outcome:** An optimized
vendor solution that delivers maximum value through strategic
multicloud partnerships, volume-based pricing agreements, and
streamlined vendor management processes, resulting in reduced
overall cloud and software costs while maintaining access to
research tools and services.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Create a vendor management system that tracks cloud-related
contracts, renewals, and usage.

Implement a
[multicloud](https://aws.amazon.com/multicloud/)
strategy to use AWS services and negotiate better rates.

Develop a standardized process for evaluating and onboarding new
cloud services or research tools.

Establish volume-based discounts with key software providers used
across multiple research projects.

### Implementation steps

- Establish a vendor management system:

Select and implement a vendor management solution.
- Document contract terms, renewal dates, and pricing
structures.
- Set up automated alerts for contract renewals and
reviews.

- Implement a multicloud strategy:

Assess current cloud service providers and their
offerings.
- Develop migration plans for workload distribution.
- Create policies for selecting cloud services across
providers.

- Standardize your vendor evaluation process:

Create a formal evaluation checklist for new services.
- Define approval workflows for new vendor onboarding.
- Establish security and regulatory requirements.

- Negotiate volume-based agreements:

Identify high-usage software and services.
- Analyze usage patterns across research projects.
- Develop negotiation strategies for bulk pricing.

- Implement continuous improvement:

Schedule regular vendor performance reviews.
- Monitor market trends and new offerings.
- Update vendor management strategies.

# LSCOST01-BP03 Build the right skills and fostering a cost-aware culture

Building the right skills and fostering a cost-aware culture is
crucial for effective cloud financial management in the life
sciences industry. This involves educating teams about the financial
implications of their cloud usage and empowering them to make
cost-effective decisions.

**Desired outcome:** A cost-conscious
organizational culture where team members possess the knowledge and
skills to make financially informed cloud decisions, supported by
decentralized cost management advocates that drive continuous cost
optimization without compromising research quality or regulatory
requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Develop focused training programs for employees that foster a
cost-aware culture and teach optimization techniques for
compliance-based workloads.

Implement a gamification system that rewards research teams for
cost-effective cloud usage while maintaining research quality (for
example, [AWS GameDay](https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/)).

Create a program where individuals from different departments are
trained as cloud cost management advocates to establish
decentralized Cloud Financial Management (CFM) capabilities across
the organization.

### Implementation steps

- Develop training programs:

Create role-specific training modules.
- Design hands-on workshops for cloud cost optimization.
- Develop compliance-focused training materials.

- Implement a gamification system:

Design reward mechanisms for cost-effective cloud usage.
- Set up AWS GameDay framework.
- Define metrics for measuring success.

- Create a cloud cost management advocacy program:

Identify potential advocates across departments.
- Develop advocate training curriculum.
- Define advocate responsibilities.

- Foster collaborative learning:

Organize cost optimization workshops.
- Create cross-functional teams.
- Schedule knowledge-sharing sessions.
