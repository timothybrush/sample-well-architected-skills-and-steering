# LSOPS07-BP01 Maintain a controlled multi-account environment

Implement standardized account management using templated
environments and automated account provisioning. Establish
organizational guardrails through policies and baseline
configurations. Maintain centralized control over shared services
while providing consistent security across accounts.

**Desired outcome:** Identifiable
resource allocation

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Combining resources into a single account and attempting to
separate it with complex rules.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** Improved security and auditability.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Implement a structured multi-account strategy that separates
workloads based on their regulatory requirements, security needs,
and operational characteristics. Centralized governance mechanisms
can enforce consistent controls across the accounts while allowing
appropriate flexibility for different workload types. Standardized
account provisioning verifies that new environments are created
with baseline controls already in place, while continuous
monitoring verifies ongoing adherence to organizational standards.

When implementing a controlled multi-account environment, balance
centralized governance with workload-specific requirements.
Establish clear guidelines for account structure and
responsibility boundaries, but allow teams appropriate autonomy
within those guardrails. Implement preventive controls for
critical requirements while using detective controls and
remediation for less critical aspects. This approach maintains
appropriate control while enabling innovation and operational
efficiency.

### Implementation steps

- Design a multi-account structure aligned with regulatory
boundaries:

- Implement AWS Organizations for hierarchical account
management.
- Consider AWS Control Tower for standardized account
governance.

- Establish centralized identity and access management:

- Configure AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized user
management.
- Consider AWS IAM Roles for fine-grained permission controls.

- Implement standardized account provisioning processes:

- Use AWS Control Tower Account Factory for consistent account
creation.
- Consider Service Catalog for standardized environment
provisioning.

- Deploy preventive guardrails for critical requirements:

- Configure AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs)
for preventive controls.
- Consider AWS Control Tower Guardrails for additional
preventive measures.

- Establish baseline configurations across accounts:

- Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets for multi-account resource
deployment.
- Consider AWS Systems Manager for configuration management.

- Implement centralized monitoring and verification:

- Configure AWS Config Aggregators for multi-account
visibility.
- Consider AWS Security Hub CSPM for consolidated security and
monitoring.

# LSOPS07-BP02 Isolate GxP data from non-GxP data

Take steps to isolate and segment GxP data from non-GxP data. In
conjunction with the recommendations around data discovery and
classification, separate GxP data so the organization can implement
the necessary technical and administrative controls.

**Desired outcome:** Demonstrable
division between GxP and non-GxP data.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Granting access at a workload level grants access to the data,
GxP and non-GxP.
- Retaining logs that are adjacent to GxP relevant metadata.
- Including GxP data in logs.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Incorporate system separation, including table and row-level
access controls.

### Implementation steps

- Foster system separation though architecture design and
deployment.  Create distinct datastores (like Amazon S3 and
Amazon RDS) for GxP data.
- Implement table and row-level access controls through
application logic.
- Apply AWS Lake Formation rules for consistent control to
data sets.
- Produce evidence of verification of access controls.
