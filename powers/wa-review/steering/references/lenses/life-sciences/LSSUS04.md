# LSSUS04-BP01 Continuously improve the monitoring of resource consumption

Implement comprehensive monitoring systems that track resource
consumption across manufacturing and laboratory equipment to enable
data-driven sustainability improvements. Deploy IoT sensors and
real-time monitoring solutions that provide visibility into energy
usage, material consumption, and operational efficiency patterns.
Establish predictive analytics capabilities that identify
optimization opportunities and support proactive maintenance
strategies.

**Desired outcome:** Achieve
comprehensive visibility into resource consumption patterns across
manufacturing operations, enabling data-driven decisions that reduce
energy usage, minimize waste, and optimize equipment efficiency
while maintaining production quality and regulatory adherence.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You don't monitor resource consumption at the equipment level,
relying only on facility-wide measurements.
- You use fixed sampling rates for your equipment regardless of
operational patterns.
- You don't implement predictive maintenance based on resource
consumption patterns.
- You don't correlate resource consumption with production output
and quality metrics.
- You don't establish baseline measurements to track
sustainability improvements over time.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduce energy consumption through equipment optimization and
predictive maintenance.
- Minimize material waste and improve resource utilization
efficiency.
- Enable predictive maintenance that reduces equipment downtime
and extends asset lifecycles.
- Support regulatory adherence and sustainability reporting
requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Manufacturing environments in life sciences require sophisticated
monitoring approaches due to the critical nature of production
processes and strict regulatory requirements. Equipment such as
bioreactors, chromatography systems, and analytical instruments
consume significant resources while requiring precise operational
conditions. Implementing comprehensive monitoring enables
organizations to optimize resource consumption without
compromising product quality or regulatory adherence.

Real-time monitoring with IoT sensors provides granular visibility
into equipment performance and resource consumption patterns. This
data enables predictive analytics that can identify
inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and optimize
operational parameters for sustainability. The key is implementing
monitoring systems that balance data collection granularity with
processing efficiency, using adaptive sampling rates that respond
to operational conditions and baseline activity levels.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy IoT sensors for comprehensive equipment monitoring:

Install IoT sensors on critical manufacturing equipment
(bioreactors, HVAC systems, analytical instruments).
- Monitor energy consumption, water usage, compressed air
consumption, and waste generation.
- Use tools like AWS IoT Device Management for centralized
sensor configuration and management.
- Implement solutions such as AWS IoT Greengrass for edge
processing and local data aggregation.

- Establish real-time monitoring and data collection systems:

Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time data
ingestion from manufacturing equipment.
- Implement AWS IoT Analytics for processing and analyzing
manufacturing data.
- Store time-series data in Amazon Timestream for
efficient querying and analysis.
- Create real-time dashboards using Quick for
operational visibility.

- Implement adaptive sampling and data efficiency strategies:

Configure dynamic sampling rates based on equipment
operational states.
- Use AWS IoT Rules Engine to filter and route data based
on operational conditions.
- Implement data compression and aggregation at the edge
to reduce network usage.
- Establish baseline activity monitoring to optimize data
collection frequency.

- Deploy predictive analytics for maintenance and
optimization:

Use Amazon SageMaker AI to build predictive models for
equipment maintenance.
- Implement anomaly detection using Amazon Lookout for
Equipment.
- Create predictive analytics for resource consumption
optimization.
- Use AWS Lambda for automated responses to monitoring
alerts and anomalies.

# LSSUS04-BP02 Use digital twins to optimize resource usage through in silico experimentation

Implement digital twin technologies to create virtual
representations of manufacturing processes that enable in silico
experimentation and optimization without consuming physical
resources. Use these virtual environments to test different
operational scenarios, optimize process parameters, and minimize
resource consumption before implementing changes in physical
systems. Use simulation capabilities to reduce the need for physical
experiments while improving process efficiency and sustainability
outcomes.

**Desired outcome:** Significantly
reduce physical experimentation requirements and resource
consumption by using digital twins for process optimization, while
improving manufacturing efficiency and reducing time-to-market for
process improvements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You rely solely on physical experiments for process optimization
without considering digital simulation alternatives.
- You implement process changes without first testing them in
virtual environments.
- You don't use historical data to improve digital twin accuracy
and predictive capabilities.
- You don't validate digital twin predictions against real-world
outcomes to improve model accuracy.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduce physical experimentation costs and resource consumption.
- Accelerate process optimization cycles and reduce time-to-market
for improvements.
- Minimize material waste and energy consumption during process
development.
- Enable safe testing of extreme operational scenarios without
risk to physical equipment.
- Improve process understanding and predictive capabilities for
better decision-making.
- Support regulatory submissions with comprehensive simulation
data and analysis.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Digital twins in life sciences manufacturing provide unprecedented
opportunities to optimize processes while minimizing resource
consumption and environmental impact. These virtual
representations enable process development teams to explore
optimization scenarios that would be costly, time-consuming, or
potentially risky to test in physical systems. For example,
chromatography process optimization can involve testing hundreds
of parameter combinations virtually before implementing the most
promising approaches in actual equipment.

The effectiveness of digital twins depends on the quality of
underlying data and models. Life sciences manufacturing processes
often involve complex biochemical interactions that require
sophisticated modeling approaches. However, the investment in
creating accurate digital twins pays dividends through reduced
physical experimentation, faster optimization cycles, and improved
process understanding. Integration with real-time monitoring data
keeps digital twins accurate and provides valuable insights
throughout the manufacturing lifecycle.
