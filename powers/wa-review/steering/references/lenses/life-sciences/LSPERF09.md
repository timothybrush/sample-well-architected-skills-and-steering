# LSPERF09-BP01 Evaluate data stores based on regulatory requirements and data governance capabilities

Select data stores that provide features for healthcare regulations
(HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP) including audit trails, data
integrity controls, and encryption at rest and in transit. Assess
the data store's ability to implement role-based access controls,
data lineage tracking, and automated retention policies. For
clinical data, prioritize solutions offering validated environments
and regulatory documentation, while verifying that research data
stores can accommodate less restrictive access patterns for
collaboration and discovery workflows.

**Desired outcome:** Implement
balanced security and governance framework that enforces robust
controls while maintaining research flexibility, automates processes
with minimal manual intervention, and provides comprehensive audit
documentation across critical systems.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish a comprehensive evaluation system for assessing data
store audit capabilities. This foundation aligns with healthcare
regulations while maintaining required security and governance
features.

Implement robust role-based access management across different
data stores. This framework should support varied access patterns
while maintaining strict regulatory requirements for clinical
data.

Deploy comprehensive security measures including encryption and
audit mechanisms. This system should preserve data integrity while
supporting both clinical and research workflows.

Design integrated governance framework that spans different data
stores. This assists with consistent policy enforcement while
accommodating different workflow requirements.

Establish systematic validation processes for clinical data
environments. This framework should maintain regulatory adherence
while enabling efficient research collaboration.

### Implementation steps

- Deploy regulatory process mapping and automated monitoring
systems.
- Implement end-to-end encryption and comprehensive audit
trail mechanisms.
- Establish role-based access control with automated review
procedures.
- Create data lineage tracking with visualization
capabilities.
- Deploy automated policy enforcement and documentation
systems.
- Implement continuous security monitoring and response
protocols.

# LSPERF09-BP02 Optimize query performance and meet diverse data access requirements in your environment

Analyze your organization's specific query patterns. Select
OLTP-optimized stores for transactional clinical applications
requiring low-latency point queries, and columnar stores (like
Amazon Redshift) for analytical workloads involving large-scale
clinical trial analysis. For unstructured research data, evaluate
stores based on throughput requirements for genomic processing,
search capabilities for literature and imaging data, and integration
with machine learning pipelines. Consider hybrid approaches where
query engines can span multiple storage types to avoid data
duplication.

**Desired outcome:** Implement
high-performance multi-store architecture that maintains consistent
query response times across storage types, enables seamless
cross-store integration with minimal latency, scales linearly under
peak loads, and optimizes resource utilization through automated
workload management.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish comprehensive system for analyzing and categorizing
query patterns across different workloads. This foundation enables
optimal storage selection while assisting to meet performance
requirements for various use cases.

Design storage architecture that aligns specific data stores with
workload characteristics. This framework should optimize
performance for both transactional and analytical requirements
while minimizing redundancy.

Implement monitoring and optimization mechanisms across different
storage types. This creates consistency in performance levels
while maintaining efficiency for varied access patterns.

Deploy unified query capabilities across multiple storage systems.
This framework should enable seamless data access while optimizing
for specific workload requirements.

Design storage solutions that accommodate growth in both data
volume and query complexity. This improves long-term performance
sustainability while maintaining cost efficiency

### Implementation steps

- Deploy comprehensive workload monitoring and classification
systems.
- Implement multi-storage architecture with OLTP and columnar
capabilities.
- Create automated performance optimization and testing
procedures.
- Deploy unified query management with cross-store
integration.
- Establish automated scaling and capacity planning
mechanisms.
- Implement resource monitoring and growth management
protocols.
