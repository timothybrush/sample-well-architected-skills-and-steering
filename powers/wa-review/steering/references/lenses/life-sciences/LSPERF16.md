# LSPERF16-BP01 Deploy intelligent traffic shaping with security-aware bandwidth allocation for different data types

Develop traffic classification systems to identify life sciences
data transfers and apply security and throughput policies based on
sensitivity and size. Set up dynamic bandwidth allocation that
prioritizes large research data transfers during off-peak times
while maintaining security measures. Implement compression and
de-duplication before encryption to reduce transmission volume and
improve efficiency without compromising security.

**Desired outcome:** You have an
intelligent traffic management system that automatically classifies
and optimizes life sciences data transfers while maintaining
security controls. This enables efficient use of network resources
without compromising data protection requirements.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Establish comprehensive classification systems that automatically
identify and categorize life sciences data types based on
sensitivity levels and transfer requirements. Create policies that
map security controls and bandwidth allocation rules to different
data classifications.

Design intelligent bandwidth allocation systems that adapt to
network conditions and usage patterns. Implement automated
scheduling for large data transfers during off-peak periods while
maintaining required security controls.

Configure compression and de-duplication mechanisms that operate
before encryption to maximize transfer efficiency. Implement
monitoring systems to verify that optimization doesn't impact data
integrity or security requirements.

### Implementation steps

- Implement comprehensive data classification with AWS Network Firewall for traffic categorization, Application Load Balancer for content-based routing, and AWS WAF rules for
precise traffic identification.
- Deploy bandwidth management tools including AWS Transit Gateway for centralized traffic control, VPC traffic
mirroring for detailed analysis, and AWS Global Accelerator
for optimized routing across networks.
- Establish multi-layered security with AWS Shield for DDoS
protection, AWS WAF rate-based rules to block abuse, and
security groups for granular traffic control between
resources.
- Configure detailed monitoring and analytics using Amazon CloudWatch for bandwidth metrics, VPC Flow Logs for traffic
pattern analysis, and Amazon GuardDuty for automated threat
detection and response.
- Document traffic management policies with classification
criteria, bandwidth allocation priorities, and security
enforcement points.
- Implement automated alerting for unusual traffic patterns,
bandwidth threshold violations, and potential security
issues.
- Conduct regular traffic analysis to optimize bandwidth
allocation and security rules based on evolving usage
patterns.
