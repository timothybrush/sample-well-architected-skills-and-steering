# LSREL04-BP01 Map regulatory requirements to reliability controls

Create a comprehensive mapping between applicable regulatory
requirements (like GxP, 21 CFR Part 11, and GDPR) and your
reliability controls. Document how each control satisfies specific
regulatory requirements and maintain this mapping as regulations
evolve. For example, if regulations require system availability of
99.9% for critical applications, implement and document the
architecture decisions, monitoring systems, and recovery procedures
that support this requirement.

**Desired outcome:** A clear,
documented traceability matrix between regulatory requirements and
implemented reliability controls that demonstrates adherence and
guides architecture decisions. This mapping serves as evidence
during audits and inspections while verifying that reliability
measures directly address regulatory obligations.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing reliability controls without considering regulatory
requirements.
- Failing to document how reliability controls satisfy specific
regulations.
- Not updating the mapping when regulations or system architecture
changes.
- Focusing only on technical controls without considering
procedural and documentation requirements.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Provides clear evidence of regulatory adherence for audits and
inspections.
- Aligns reliability investments with regulatory priorities.
- Facilitates impact assessment when regulations change.
- Supports risk-based decision making for reliability investments.

## Implementation guidance

Use AWS Config to track configuration changes that might affect
adherence to regulatory requirements.

Consider implementing AWS Audit Manager to continuously audit your
AWS usage to simplify risk assessment and adherence with
regulations.

Implement tagging strategies to identify resources subject to
specific regulatory requirements.

Use AWS Systems Manager documents to standardize and automate
checks.

### Implementation steps

- Identify the applicable regulatory requirements related to
system reliability (like FDA, EMA, and ICH).
- Create a traceability matrix documenting each requirement
and corresponding control.
- Use AWS Config to establish configuration rules that enforce
regulatory requirements.
- Implement AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor adherence to
availability requirements.
- Document architecture decisions that support regulatory
requirements using AWS Well-Architected Tool.
- Establish a review process to update the mapping when
regulations or systems change.

# LSREL04-BP02 Implement risk-based reliability testing for regulated systems

Develop a risk-based approach to reliability testing that
prioritizes critical system components based on patient safety, data
integrity, and regulatory impact. For high-risk components in GxP
systems, implement more rigorous testing including fault injection,
recovery testing, and performance under stress. Document test
results as part of your evidence package.

**Desired outcome:** A comprehensive
testing program that verifies reliability requirements are met, with
testing depth proportional to risk. The testing approach provides
documented evidence that systems can maintain reliability under
various conditions, supporting both regulatory adherence and
operational confidence.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Applying the same level of testing to each component regardless
of risk.
- Focusing only on functional testing while neglecting reliability
aspects.
- Not documenting test procedures and results for regulatory
evidence.
- Testing only in development environments without validating
production configurations.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Focuses testing resources on components with the highest risk
assessment.
- Provides documented evidence of reliability for regulatory
submissions.
- Identifies potential failures before they impact operations.
- Builds confidence in system resilience under adverse conditions.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Use AWS Fault Injection Service to safely test system resilience
through controlled experiments.

Consider implementing AWS Resilience Hub to assess and improve
application resilience.

Implement chaos engineering principles using AWS Fault Injection Service for GxP-critical systems.

Use AWS CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries that continuously
verify critical paths.

### Implementation steps

- Perform a risk assessment to categorize system components by
regulatory impact.
- Define testing protocols with depth and frequency based on
risk categories.
- Implement automated testing using Amazon CloudWatch
Synthetics for continuous verification.
- Use AWS Fault Injection Service to test recovery mechanisms
for high-risk components.
- Document test procedures, results, and remediation actions
in a format suitable for regulatory review.
- Establish a regular cadence for reviewing and updating
testing protocols.

# LSREL04-BP03 Establish reliability qualification procedures

Create formal verification procedures for reliability aspects of
your system that align with regulatory expectations. Include
installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and
performance qualification (PQ) elements that verify reliability
features like high availability, disaster recovery, and data backup
and restore capabilities. Maintain these qualification records as
part of your regulatory documentation.

**Desired outcome:** A formal,
documented qualification process that verifies reliability features
work as intended and meet regulatory requirements. The qualification
procedures provide evidence that the system can reliably perform its
intended functions under expected conditions and recover from
failures, satisfying both technical reliability needs and regulatory
requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Focusing qualification only on functional aspects while
neglecting reliability features.
- Not including disaster recovery and failover testing in
qualification procedures.
- Qualifying systems only at initial deployment without
re-qualification after significant changes.
- Documenting only successful test results without capturing and
addressing failures.
- Separating reliability qualification from the overall validation
process.
- Using manual, non-repeatable qualification procedures that can't
be consistently executed.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Provides documented evidence of reliability capabilities for
regulatory adherence.
- Thoroughly verifies reliability features before production use.
- Establishes baseline performance for monitoring and continuous
improvement.
- Reduces risk of reliability-related findings during inspections.
- Builds confidence in the system's ability to maintain data
integrity during failures.
- Creates a foundation for continuous adherence as systems evolve.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Use AWS Systems Manager documents to create standardized
qualification procedures.

Consider AWS Backup for testing and validating backup and recovery
procedures.

Implement infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation for
consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployment.

Use AWS Config to verify that production environments match
qualified configurations.

Consider implementing AWS Resilience Hub to assess application
resilience against defined resilience policies.

Use AWS Fault Injection Service to validate recovery procedures in
a controlled manner.

### Implementation steps

- Define qualification protocols for reliability features
(like HA, DR, or backup and restore) based on risk
assessment.
- Create IQ procedures to verify infrastructure components are
properly installed and configured:

- Validate AWS service configurations match design
specifications.
- Verify networking components, security controls, and
monitoring systems.

- Develop OQ procedures to test reliability features under
normal conditions:

- Test automatic failover between availability zones.
- Verify data replication mechanisms function correctly.
- Validate backup processes complete successfully.

- Establish PQ procedures to verify performance under expected
load and stress conditions:

- Test system recovery after simulated failures.
- Verify data integrity is maintained during recovery
operations.
- Validate system meets defined recovery time and point
objectives.

- Document qualification results with evidence of successful
testing.
- Implement change control procedures to maintain qualified
state and determine when re-qualification is required.
